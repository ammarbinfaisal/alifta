A Muslim should invite people to Allah (Exalted be He), encourage them to propagate virtue and prevent vice, and fear the blame of no one except Allah. Every Muslim should enjoin goodness and forbid evil with regard to all people including his relatives and beloved ones. It is his duty towards them to encourage them to do goodness and forbid them from doing evil and they will be rewarded for this. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned Thus, it is obligatory upon all the believing men and women to fear Allah (Exalted be He) and fulfill their duties towards their relatives and people in general. Allah (Glorified be He) says, O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allâh, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin",

It is very important to advise or guide your relatives to goodness. This is better than giving them money, for guiding and encouraging them to do goodness and stop doing evil is more important than money, as this will benefit them in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. Your sister should not abandon enjoining goodness or forbidding evil, because of her love for her son, brother, sister, and so on. She should enjoin goodness and forbid evil in the way that she deems useful and helpful until she succeeds In sha'a­Allah (if Allah wills) and is free of guilt.",

With regard to his head, they also differed concerning that; it was said that it is buried in Al­Sham or in Iraq or in Egypt. The correct view is that the site in Egypt is not his grave, rather that is a mistake and the head of Al­Husayn is not there. A number of scholars have written essays on that and explained that there is no evidence for the head of al­Husayn being in Egypt. The most likely view to be correct is the view that it is in Al­Sham, because it was taken to Yazid ibn Mu`awiyah who was in Al­Sham. There is no basis for the view that it was taken to Egypt. Either it was kept in Al­Sham or it was returned to his body in Iraq.",

Visiting graves to supplicate to dead people or beseech their help or intercession is a reprehensible action and indeed it is major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). It is not permissible to build mosques or domes over graves, because the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: \"May Allah curse the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.\" (Agreed upon by Imams Al­ Bukhari and Muslim) It is authentically narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade plastering of graves, sitting on them, and building over them. So it is not permissible to plaster over graves, perfume them, place screens around them or build over them; all of that is forbidden and these are means that lead to Shirk. And we should not pray at the graves, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you should not take graves as Masjids (mosques); I forbid you to do that. [Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book on the authority of Jundub ibn `Abdullaah Al­Bajaly(may Allah be pleased with him)] This Hadith indicates that it is not permissible to pray at the graves or to take them as Masjids, because this is a means to Shirk and worshipping someone other than Allah by calling upon them (the occupants of the graves), seeking their help, making vows to them, and touching their graves to seek their blessings. Hence the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against that. Rather graves should be visited in the manner prescribed in Shari`ah (Islamic law) only, to give Salam to them and make Du`a' for them and pray for them to have mercy without traveling specifically for that purpose. Allah is the Source of strength and the Guide to the straight path.",

If he slaughters an animal at any time intending to give charity to the poor on their behalf, then there is no harm in doing so because charity benefits both the dead and the living, whether it is meat or something else like money or food. All these benefit the dead and the living. It is authentically narrated from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) that he was asked whether a woman whose son gives charities on behalf of her after her death will receive a reward. He answered in the affirmative. It is narrated in Sahih Muslim(may Allah be merciful with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon) said: When a man dies, his acts come to an end but three: a recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (i.e. for the deceased). In conclusion, giving Sadaqah on behalf of the deceased is beneficial to him or her according to the consensus of Muslim scholars. The same applies to supplicating Allah (Exalted be He) for him. Thus, such a person can slaughter an animal on behalf of his father, grandfather, or any other person, whether intending to offer it as charity or as a sacrifice to be slaughtered throughout the four days of `Eid­ul­Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) to draw them nearer to Allah (may He be Praised and Glorified). However, it is not allowed",

There is no harm in doing so. There is a reward for the dead as well as the person offering the sacrifice according to the degree of his sincerity to Allah (Exalted be He) and the lawfulness of his earnings. On the contrary, if such a person does so intending to draw nearer to the dead as done by those sacrificing for the dead, the sun, the moon, or Jinn, then this is an act of major Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah), because it is not permissible for any one to draw near to any person through slaughtering, vowing, or any other act of worship exclusively confined to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Say (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ): \"Verily, my Salât (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allâh, the Lord of the 'Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). \"He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.\" Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) Al­Kauthar (a river in Paradise). Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only). The Prophet (Peace be upon him) also says: \"Allah has cursed the one who slaughters (a sacrifice) to other than Allah…\" Narrated by Muslimin his Sahih. Thus, slaughtering for the Jinn, the dead, or other creatures, such as idols, planets, and the like, whether the slaughterer hopes for their intercession, believes that they benefit or save him from illness, or the like is legally unacceptable and Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah). The one who slaughters on behalf of one's father or grandfather believing that they can benefit him, cure an ill relative, or draw one near to Allah is like a person who slaughters for the sun, the moon, or the stars. All such acts are Shirk. We implore Allah to grant us safety.",
