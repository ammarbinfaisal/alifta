So, if there is a fear of sickness and a person is vaccinated against an infection that is present in the country or elsewhere, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is a kind of protection. As the current disease is to be treated by medicine, so the feared disease is to be treated as well. However, it is not permissible to wear or hang up amulets against sickness, the jinn, or the evil eye, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade that and explained that this is a kind of minor Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah), so it must be avoided.",

This rejects the pre­Islamic beliefs that contagious diseases such as scabies are contagious by themselves and that anyone who mixes with the sick will be afflicted with the same sickness. This is false, as it occurs because Allah wills and ordains so. As it is known, the person may mix with the sick and they will not be afflicted. Thus, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about mixing the healthy camels and the camels afflicted with scabies, he replied that, Who infected the first one? With regard to his saying, One should run away from the leper as one runs away from a lion and the other report in which he narrated, The sick should not be brought to the healthy (i.e. the owner of a sick camel should not mix it with the healthy camels), they show that it is impermissible to believe that contagious disease transfers without Allah's permission.

On the other hand, it is impermissible for a person to shake hands with a non­Mahram woman, for a woman once outstretched her hand to shake the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he told her: I do not shake hands with women. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said: By Allah, the hands of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had never touched the hands of any woman, he only used to take their pledge of allegiance verbally (Peace be upon). Hence, it is impermissible for a woman to shake hands with non­Mahram men, as it is impermissible for a man to shake hands with non­Mahram women based on the two mentioned Hadiths.

The basic rule is that only the imperspicuous Fitnah, in which the truth cannot be distinguished from falsehood, must be avoided. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, There will be afflictions (in the near future) during which a person who is sitting will be better than one who is standing, and the person who is standing will be better than one who is walking, and the person who is walking will be better than one who is running, and whoever exposes himself to these afflictions, they will destroy him. So whoever can find a place of protection or refuge from them, should take shelter in it. (Related in the two Sahih (authentic) books of Al­Bukhari and Muslimon the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)). He (peace be upon him) also said, Before the Last Hour there will be commotions like pieces of a dark night in which a man will be a believer in the morning and a disbeliever in the evening, or a believer in the evening and an disbeliever in the morning. He who sits during them will be better than he who gets up and he who walks during them is better than he who runs. So break your bows, cut your bowstrings, and strike your swords on stones.

Then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allâh loves those who are the equitable.

This was just to cooperate with the Saudi forces to defend the country, Islam, and Muslims. There is no harm in doing so, because this is a way of seeking help to ward off oppression and to save and protect the country from the evils of wicked people and the oppression and aggression of tyrants and aggressors. There is no harm in doing so as stated clearly by the scholars. Regarding what has been rumored by some Muslim minorities who believed the claims of Saddam and his lies about the U.S. imperial interference with the affairs and sanctities of Muslims, to the end of other false rumors; actually this is a fatal misconception rumored by the party of Saddam, which is a nationalistic, not an Islamic party. Even if such people were Muslims, it is obligatory to deter them from transgression even by seeking the help of some unbelievers, particularly when proposing peaceful means to ward off evil and protect the country. The Messenger (peace be upon him) sought the help of Safwan Ibn Umayyah at the battle of Hunayn to fight against the people of Al­Ta'if. Accordingly, seeking help from unbelievers against transgressors is permissible. What is impermissible is to support the unbelievers against Muslims. As for this situation, it is a protection of Muslims and their countries from outlaws, aggressors, and unbelievers. There is a difference between the two situations: if one supports unbelievers against Muslims, this means apostasy, which is impermissible and Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect). In the current case of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has sought the help of unbelievers to deter and prevent the aggressor ­ whether a disbeliever or a believer ­ from entering the country and violating the sanctities of Islam, this is a required and necessary matter because this is for protecting Muslims from whoever may harm them, whether being a disbeliever or a believer. It is obligatory upon the Iraqi leader to repent to Allah, give up the false opinions he adopts, abandon the party of (Al­Shaitan) Satan, commit himself to Islam, rule by it, and oblige Iraqi people to abide by it. We supplicate to Allah to grant him guidance.",

He (Glorified be He) has warned against following one's own desires and obeying the enemies of Allah (Exalted be He) in ruling against His Shari`ah. He (Glorified be He) has also mentioned that His ruling is the best, and that all rulings that contradict His are of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of Ignorance). He (Glorified be He) has mentioned that ruling by what He has not revealed is Kufr (disbelief), Zhulm (injustice), and Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law), declaring that whoever does not make the Messenger (peace be upon him) judge in all his affairs, be inclined to this, and accept this with full submission will have no Iman. Hence, it is the duty of all Muslim rulers to abide by Allah's Ruling (Glorified be He), rule His servants according to His Shari`ah, and find in themselves no resistance to that. They should beware of following their desires that contradict His Shari`ah, or obeying anyone who calls to rule by any law or regulation opposing what is established by Allah's Book or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) of His Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Glorified be He) stresses that Iman can only be attained to the people of Islam in this way.",

Nevertheless, the tyrant of Iraq killed such hope in Muslims' hearts by attacking Kuwait unjustly and continuously trying to increase reasons for dissension and disagreement amongst people of the Ummah to take it many years backwards. Thus, it is greatly important, under these challenges that the Ummah faces, to hold a conversation with His Eminence Shaykh `Abdul `Aziz Bin `Abdullah Ibn Baz, Chairman of the Departments of Scholarly Research, Ifta', Daw`ah, and Guidance. This is because such a conversation reflects the view of one of the most prominent scholars of the Ummah on the events it currently faces or has faced during this century. In this conversation, our eminent Shaykh observes the reality of the situation, defines the reasons and factors that led to the weakness that the Ummah suffers from, and tells about the effective remedy for getting rid of these burdens and worries that hinder its progress. `Ukazh thus introduces this comprehensive conversation that it held with the eminent Shaykh to shed light on all the foregoing along with some other points that concern Muslims nowadays:",

Since the help of an untrustworthy Muslim, like one who weakens the morale of the Muslims and spreads rumors to dishearten them, is forbidden to be sought, the help of the disbeliever is also forbidden to be sought in this case.",

It is confirmed that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"You people present your cases to me and some of you may be more eloquent and persuasive in presenting their argument than others. If, as a result, I give someone's right to another, I am in fact giving them a piece of the Fire. They can either take it or leave it.\" (Agreed upon by Al­Bukhari and Muslimand it was related on the authority of Um Salamah, may Allah be pleased with her). The Hadith means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) could practice Ijtihad in judgments based on Shari`ah when there was no evidence revealed regarding them. Anyone who knew the judgment was not based on the truth and had presented false witnesses had indeed taken a piece of the Fire. They should beware of that and fear Allah, even if the judge was the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).",

If I am to take any one of my nation as a friend, I would take Abu Bakr as a Khalil.

He showed it was the practice of those before us who incurred Allah's Anger and those who went astray. It is a dispraised act, as it leads to Shirk and exceeds the proper limits in relation to prophets and righteous men. Therefore, it is not permissible for Muslims to build domes or places of worship over the graves of their dead, for this act is Munkar (unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and leads to Shirk. Consequently, it is not permissible to plaster, build over, and sit on the graves. It is related inMuslimon the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade these practices. In other Hadith, he (peace be upon him) forbade writing on graves and lighting them. The reason behind these prohibitions is to block the means leading to Shirk and to block the way of exceeding the proper limits. Moreover, sitting on the graves is an insult to their inhabitants.

This emanates from the fact that a person believes that Allah (may He be Praised) is the One worthy of worship, since He is the Creator, the Provider, the Perfect in His Names, Attributes and Actions and the Disposer of all affairs. Therefore, He is truly worthy of worship. In other words, Tawhid means making acts of worship exclusive to Allah Alone and negating them from others. Iman, however, has a broader sense, because it encompasses Tawhid and sincerity to Allah as well as believing in all that He revealed",

Scholars of this school of thought do not recognize Qiyas or Ta`lil. They formulate their opinions based on the literal meaning of the commands and prohibitions and totally overlook the rationale and the implicit meanings. For that reason, they were called Zhahiriyyah, because they adhere to the literal meanings without looking into the causes, rationale and Shar`y Qiyas that the Qur'an and Sunnah support. Nonetheless, their views in general are better than that of the people of Ra'y (personal opinion) who totally depend on reasoning and Qiyas and overlook the Shar`y proofs from the Qur'an and Sunnah. The Zhahiriyyah school of thought has some deficits and is condemned for their adherence to the literal meaning of the texts without considering the causes, rationale and the secrets that Allah or His Prophet cited and intended.

Those people should not be forced to embrace Islam; they should be given the choice either to embrace Islam or pay the Jizyah. Some scholars held that this ruling was enforced during the early days of Islam, but later on it was abrogated by Allah's command to fight and perform Jihad. According to this opinion, a non­Muslim who refuses to embrace Islam must be fought until he either embraces Islam or pays the Jizyah if he meets its conditions. Thus, it is obligatory to oblige the disbelievers to accept Islam, if they are not among those who pay the Jizyah because their conversion to Islam brings about their happiness and salvation in the worldly life and the Hereafter.

Allah (Exalted be He) says: And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war), as well as many benefits for mankind Allah (Exalted be He) also says: And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]. They fought those who refused for their own sake and safety. In general, whoever is indebted with any right to another should be obliged to fulfill this right either by jailing or beating, yet this person is unjustly treated. If this is the case, how can a person condemn or find it queer to oblige whoever is indebted to Allah to fulfill His Rights (Exalted be He)? Accordingly, with greater reason, the most important right and the worthiest of being fulfilled is the observance of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) to Allah (may he be Glorified) and the abandonment of associating others with Him. It is a Mercy from Allah (Glorified be He) to prescribe fighting and observance of Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) against Mushrikun (those who associate others in worship with Allah) so as to enforce them to single out Allah (Exalted be He) with worship and quit worshipping any thing other than Him. This leads to their happiness and safety in the worldly life and the Hereafter. Allah is the One Who grants success.",

I was very happy to know about your actions against the destructive principles and the harm you encountered because of that. In fact, this is the way of the messengers and their followers who are often tried but finally had the successful outcome. Thus, I recommend you to endure this patiently and have glad tidings. I reviewed the attached lecture entitled \"Our Position in the Methodology of Islam\" and found it generally good and fruitful. However, there are certain topics that look a little vague. For instance, in page number 3, it is written: \"Islam deems everyone separates himself from such a state and forms a new class or power centers, a disbeliever in Islam...\" We advise you to give attention to clarity and avoid generalization as much as you can when you prepare a lecture.",

I suggest that you work in the field of preaching and guidance in Kuwait and there is no blame on you at all to receive a salary for that type of work as you would take it for your work in teaching. Work in both fields, actually, involves calling to Allah, educating and instructing people, enjoining the Ma`ruf (that which is judged as good, beneficial, or fitting by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and forbidding the Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect). Also, there is no harm that a Muslim takes money from Bayt­u l­Mal (Muslim treasury) to help him continue his work in teaching, preaching, guiding, leading people in Salah (prayer), Adhan (call to Prayer), or any work of righteousness. Scholars differed as to the ruling of receiving a fee for teaching the Qur'an or leading people in Salah from someone other than Bayt­ul­Mal. In fact, the Companions of the Messenger (peace be upon him) received money from Bayt­u l­Mal that helped them to do acts of obedience to Allah and perform Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah). This took place during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the rightly­guided caliphs, though the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were the most prudent of people, who fear Allah most and know His laws best after the prophets. We have an excellent example in the Companions regarding this point. May Allah guide us all to what pleases Him! May Allah grant you, us and all Muslims understanding of Islam and steadfastness in it! Indeed, Allah is All­Hearer, Ever Near. As­salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.",

I hope Your Eminence could issue an order to the undermining of this grave and preventing people from excessively praising it and offering sacrifices for its dweller. Excessiveness related to graves is an act of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance). Besides, drawing closer to the dwellers of graves by offering sacrifices or vows or seeking their help are acts of Jahiliyyah, which Muslim rulers should end. The mortal remains should be moved to the public cemetery; each corpse should be buried in a separate hole in the ground, and its surface should be leveled like all other graves in order to hide it from people, lest they should return to overpraising it again. It was reported that `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) did the same with the grave of Daniel that the Persians used to overparsie; he ordered them to dig thirteen graves during the daylight and to put the corpse in one of them at night to level all the graves so that people could not discern his grave. May Allah bless you wherever you are and make the religion victorious with your support! May Allah guide you to do that which He loves and that which pleases Him!

This is the original basis, unless an Islamic interest requires covert advice, for fear that some people may be too proud to accept open public advice. In this case, the advice should be in secret. The advisor and guide should seek the appropriate way to deliver advice; if advising, calling and helping in righteousness in public can benefit the attendants and provide public interest, he should do so. If the interest requires providing advice in secret, he should do so. The objective is to avail the one advised and the whole society; so whatever means can achieve this is required, whether in secret or in public. The advisor and caller to Allah are like the physician who seeks the appropriate time, quantity and quality.

They gave an example of the film which was presented by Swiss television about Islam and Muslims in Egypt. The movie contains un­Islamic scenes as it showed the practices and the celebrations held at the graves, celebrating the birthday of Al­Badawy, in addition to many other Bid`ahs (innovations in religion).",

If anyone invites others to follow error, their sin will be equivalent to that of the people who follow them (in sinfulness) without their sins being diminished in any respect.

This also includes the right of being a good neighbor. You should never harm your non­Muslim neighbors but you should give them charity if they are needy, present them with gifts, and advise them. This may be a cause of their being guided to Islam and as our neighbors have rights on us.

(Agreed upon by Imams Al­Bukhari and Muslim).If the neighbor is a non­Muslim, they have the right of kind treatment. If they are relatives, they have a double right: the right of a neighbor and the right of kinship. It is permissible for a Muslim to give Sadaqah (voluntary charity), not Zakah, to a neighbor who is a Kafir, provided that they are not warriors.

I was devoted to Allah and hopeful of Allah's Reward, performing Salah (prayer) and Sawm (fast) and calling to Allah. I was jealous of the status of Muslims till I took part in Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) in Afghanistan. I promised Allah not to return till I achieved victory; but I became weak and returned in two months, upon the insistence of my parents. Then, my whole life changed to the extent that I doubt the existence of Allah and the authenticity of the Ever-Glorious Qur'an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). I pushed such thoughts away and searched in the tapes and books of Sheikh Al-Zandany and Al-Haqq (the Truth) appeared. Nevertheless, some doubts and insinuations still haunt me. The gravest disaster is that I do not feel fear of Allah in my heart. I constantly make Istighfar (seeking forgiveness from Allah) as I have been suffering from this for a year and half. I tried everything to make sure of Al-Haqq and dispel such doubts, but in vain. As soon as I begin to follow Al-Haqq for a time, I return to what I held. I used to fast the White Days (13th, 14th, and 15th of every Hijri month) and perform Tahajjud (optional late night Prayer), I still do this but I do not feel the joy.",

Rather, they should be taken to righteous people among the reciters of the Qur'an who are well­versed in the treatment of such cases. They can recite Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) over the patient, blow over them, and use beneficial, lawful means to exorcize them. Allah has made a reason for everything and a remedy for every ailment. Jinn (creatures created from fire) are mostly exorcized ­ with Allah's Will ­ when a pious, knowledgeable believer known for uprightness and sound `Aqidah (creed) recites recommended Ayahs over the possessed and blows over them while rebuking the Jinn. Under no circumstances should a Muslim ever go to such deviant Sufis who are notorious for their Bid`ah (innovation in religion), aberrations, and superstitions. A Muslim should neither visit them nor seek their treatment, for they may harm their visitors and drag them into their Bid`ah practices and superstitions. Sufis mostly resort to Bid`ah and superstitions, and most of them worship their so­called shaykhs along with Allah, seek their help, make vows to them, and invoke them for support, whether they are alive or dead. Thus, deviant Sufis are in a dangerous state and only few among them have been able to remain uncorrupted. There is neither might nor power except with Allah! May Allah grant us and them insight and guidance to the correct way of treating such cases, described in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). It is the way followed by the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him) and those who diligently follow in their footsteps. This is the Straight Path ­ that is, Allah's Din (religion of Islam) which was revealed to His Messenger (peace be upon him). Likewise, it is not permissible for any person, whether possessed or suffering other diseases, to seek treatment from sorcerers, charlatans, or soothsayers who claim knowledge of Ghayb (the Unseen), worship anyone other than Allah, and treat patients using unlawful means prohibited by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).",

On the contrary, if a grave is in a certain place and a Masjid is built over it, the Masjid should be demolished and removed, for it is the reason for the existence of Munkar. This is because the Messenger (peace be upon him) warned against building Masjids over graves, cursed the Jews and the Christians for doing so, forbade his Ummah (nation) to imitate them, and said to `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him): Spare no portrait unwiped out, and leave not a high grave unleveled.

In this regard, I inform you that the Kharijites were not the supporters of Imam `Aly; rather, they were his opponents. He fought against and killed a large number of them. They accused him of apostasy and considered it lawful to kill him (may Allah be pleased with him). Imam `Aly was killed by Ibn Muljim, who was one of them. The Kharijites were a wicked sect who considered a Muslim who commits sins to be a Kafir (disbeliever). They opined that disobedient Muslims will abide in Hellfire forever and that they will not come out of it; the same as disbelievers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned us against them and told us that they quickly pass through (the teachings of) Islam just like an arrow passes through prey. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was upright and trustworthy as other Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), according to the viewpoint of Ahl Al­Sunnah wal­Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community). Moreover, he was the Companion who memorized most of the Hadiths of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). Neither `Umar nor any other Companion accused him of belying. Rather, they quoted his Hadiths as evidence and acted in accordance with them.

They do not obey the Commands of Allah or avoid His Prohibitions even though He has bestowed upon them wealth and other blessings. Another meaning is also suggested that they wear clothes that do not cover them, for being too light or too short. Thus, they do not serve their purpose. Hence, they are described as \"naked\", as the clothes they wear do not cover their 'Awrah (private parts of the body that must be covered in public). Over and above, \"Inclined\" means deviant from chastity and righteousness i.e. they commit sins and evil deeds like those who do immoral acts or fall short to perform the obligatory duties, prayer, etc. As for the interpretation of \"Inclining\", it means that they misguide others i.e. they call people to evil and corruption. So, they lead others to immorality and sin by words and deeds. They commit immoral actions because of their weak or fading Iman (faith/belief). This Sahih Hadith intends to warn against wrongdoing and all kinds of corruption whether committed by men or women.",

He told them that when Khadijah, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died, he slaughtered a camel and accepted condolences for three days. He claimed this was mentioned in the Hadith of Qatadah. He mentioned another Hadith without specifying the source narrator stating that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"I am a tree whose trunk is `Aly, whose branch is Fatimah, and whose fruits are Al­Hasan and Al­Hussayn.\" He mentioned a third Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was once walking in the mountains of Makkah when he met a Jewish man. He asked him, \"Have you not believed in me yet?\" The Jew replied, \"No.\" He said to him, \"Ask this tree to come.\" The Jew said, \"Muhammad asks you to come.\" So, the tree came to him covering him with its shade. He asked it, \"Who am I?\" The tree replied, \"You are Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.\" The Jew then pronounced the two Shahadahs (Testimonies of Faith). The tree then ascended to the heavens; it circumambulated around `Arsh (Allah's Throne), Kursy (Allah's Chair) and Al­Lawh­ul­Mahfuzh (the Preserved Tablet); and it asked Allah for permission to invoke peace and blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him). He (peace be upon him) asked the Jew to kiss his hands and his feet. Another tale states that `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) saw a man circumambulating around the Ka`bah, so he said to him, \"You have committed Zina (adultery).\" The man asked, \"How did you know that?\" He said, \"I saw it in your eyes.\" The man said, \"I have not committed Zina, but I looked at a Jewish woman (lustfully).\" He asked `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), \"Did you know this through Wahy (Revelation)?\" He replied, \"No, it is just a Mu'min's (believer) insight.\" When that preacher was asked for pieces of evidence on these tales, his supporters attacked us.

Consequently, menstruating women or those in postpartum period may not recite Qur'an until they become pure.

The period of Janabah however, is short, and unlike a menstruating woman or she who is having postpartum period, a junub person can immediately perform Ghusl then recite Qur'an. Accordingly, the most proper of the two opinions of scholars is that which states the permissibility for menstruating women or those who are in postpartum period to recite what they have memorized from the Qur'an. It is permissible for them to recite Ayat­ul­Kursy when they go to bed. Moreover, it is permissible for them to recite by heart whatever they like from the Qur'an at any time. This is the most proper opinion and the original ruling and thus when `Aishah menstruated during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet (peace be upon him) instructed her saying: Do what all the pilgrims do except that you do not perform the Tawaf 'circumambulation' round the Ka'ba till you are purified and he (peace be upon him) did not forbid her to",

Visiting graves to supplicate to dead people or beseech their help or intercession is a reprehensible action and indeed it is major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). It is not permissible to build mosques or domes over graves, because the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: \"May Allah curse the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.\" (Agreed upon by Imams Al­ Bukhari and Muslim) It is authentically narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade plastering of graves, sitting on them, and building over them. So it is not permissible to plaster over graves, perfume them, place screens around them or build over them; all of that is forbidden and these are means that lead to Shirk. And we should not pray at the graves, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you should not take graves as Masjids (mosques); I forbid you to do that. [Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book on the authority of Jundub ibn `Abdullaah Al­Bajaly(may Allah be pleased with him)] This Hadith indicates that it is not permissible to pray at the graves or to take them as Masjids, because this is a means to Shirk and worshipping someone other than Allah by calling upon them (the occupants of the graves), seeking their help, making vows to them, and touching their graves to seek their blessings. Hence the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against that. Rather graves should be visited in the manner prescribed in Shari`ah (Islamic law) only, to give Salam to them and make Du`a' for them and pray for them to have mercy without traveling specifically for that purpose. Allah is the Source of strength and the Guide to the straight path.",

In conclusion, giving Sadaqah on behalf of the deceased is beneficial to him or her according to the consensus of Muslim scholars. The same applies to supplicating Allah (Exalted be He) for him. Thus, such a person can slaughter an animal on behalf of his father, grandfather, or any other person, whether intending to offer it as charity or as a sacrifice to be slaughtered throughout the four days of `Eid­ul­Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) to draw them nearer to Allah (may He be Praised and Glorified). However, it is not allowed",

There is no harm in doing so. There is a reward for the dead as well as the person offering the sacrifice according to the degree of his sincerity to Allah (Exalted be He) and the lawfulness of his earnings. On the contrary, if such a person does so intending to draw nearer to the dead as done by those sacrificing for the dead, the sun, the moon, or Jinn, then this is an act of major Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah), because it is not permissible for any one to draw near to any person through slaughtering, vowing, or any other act of worship exclusively confined to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Say (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ): \"Verily, my Salât (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allâh, the Lord of the 'Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). \"He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.\" Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) Al­Kauthar (a river in Paradise). Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only). The Prophet (Peace be upon him) also says: \"Allah has cursed the one who slaughters (a sacrifice) to other than Allah…\" Narrated by Muslimin his Sahih. Thus, slaughtering for the Jinn, the dead, or other creatures, such as idols, planets, and the like, whether the slaughterer hopes for their intercession, believes that they benefit or save him from illness, or the like is legally unacceptable and Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah). The one who slaughters on behalf of one's father or grandfather believing that they can benefit him, cure an ill relative, or draw one near to Allah is like a person who slaughters for the sun, the moon, or the stars. All such acts are Shirk. We implore Allah to grant us safety.",

This is because they all mislead from the Path of Allah, harden the hearts, and distract people from listening to the Glorious Qur'an. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) told us that this leads to Dalalah (deviation from what is right) and misguidance of others, and is a cause of spreading pride and turning people away from listening to the Qur'an. If the heart becomes used to listening to music and watching singers it will harden and will be barred away from Al­Haqq (the Truth), except those whom Allah protected. It also distracts from obedience to Allah and His Messenger and from listening to the Qur'an and useful speeches. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Singing grows the seeds of hypocrisy in the heart as water grows the crops.\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Verily, among my Ummah (nation based on one creed) there will be people who will deem as lawful: Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), silk, Khamr (intoxicants) and musical instruments.\" (Related by Al­Bukhari in his \"Sahih [Book of Authentic Hadith] as Hadith Mu'allaq [a Hadith missing link in the chain of narration, reported directly from the Prophet]) and he confirmed it.The above Hadith informs us that at the end of time there will be people who will deem musical instruments and songs as lawful, although they are Haram.",

As for Salah (Prayer), its validity is debatable, for the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) holds the view that an intoxicant is Najis (ritually impure), consequently, the Salah of the one who offers it while deliberately having Najasah (ritual impurity) on the body and is aware of the ruling is not valid. Some scholars hold the view that the intoxicant does not cause Najasah. Thus, it comes to be known that the person who offers Salah with an intoxicant on their clothes or body while forgetting or ignorant of the ruling or thinking it is Tahir (ritually pure), their Salah is valid. However, to be on the safe side, they should wash off what is on their clothes or body in order to avoid the difference in scholars' opinion. If there is a kind of cologne that does not cause intoxication, it is not Haram to use it, since the `Illah (effective cause) given for a ruling exists, the ruling should be applied and vice versa.",

However, the rulers should not appoint sinners as Imams (those who leads congregational Prayer) while there are others to undertake this job. This is the right thing to do. This sinner is a Muslim and knows that Salah is obligatory, so the Salah of those behind him is valid. The supporting evidence on this is what was authentically established in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said about offering Salah behind corrupt leaders, They will lead you in Salah; if they offer it properly, the reward is for both of you; and if they offer it improperly, the reward is for you and the sin is for them. Other Hadiths that stress the same meaning were also reported from him (peace be upon him). Some of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) offered Salah behind Al­Hajjaj, who was one of the most corrupt people of his time. The Mu'mins (believers) should offer Salah in congregation, even if the Imam is a corrupt person. However, if they can offer Salah behind a just Imam, it will be better for their religion.",

They should beware of Riya', but at the same time they must discharge their obligations among men or women. Men and women are equal in this regard, as Allah (Glorified be He) states this in His Glorious Book saying: The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ' (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma'rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As­Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger.

Allah created the Throne out of one half and created water out of the other half, then He left it in that state. Hence, it trembles till the Day of Resurrection.'\" Another narration reads: \"It is reported that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Those who hold the Throne are four angels. Each of them has four faces. Their feet are planted on a rock under the seventh firmament of the earth at a distance of a five hundred year journey.'\" Please enlighten me about the authenticity of what I have read!",
