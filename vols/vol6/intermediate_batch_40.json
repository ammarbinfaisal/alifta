Among the best books of Ibn Al­Qayyim (may Allah forgive him) Al­Turuq Al­Hukmiya, A`lam Al­Muwaqi`een, and Zad Al­Mi`ad. These books have great benefits, especially for judges and Muftis (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions). This is in addition to the Fatawa of the leaders of Da`wah like Al­Durar Al­Saniyah in which many useful essays and answers of Shaykh Al­Islam Muhammad Ibn `Abdul­Wahhab, his students and followers (may Allah forgive them all) were collected. Similarly, the Fatawa of our Shaykh and well­known Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Al Al­Shaykh (may Allah forgive him). They include great knowledge and much benefit. I advise people to read these books after Allah's book and His Prophet's Sunnah (peace be upon him). They contain great knowledge and assistance for every good like similar useful books that pay much attention to evidence such as Al­Mughni, Sharh Al­Muhazab, Al­Muhalla, and other books that pay much attention to evidences and impart the views of scholars. They are very important to scholars, knowledge seekers, judges, and others. I ask Allah with His Divine Names and Higher Attributes to guide us and all Muslims to useful knowledge and good deeds. May Allah grant us all good intention, patience, and comprehension of religion to be rewarded with the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is Most Generous. May Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) guide those in charge of us and all those in charge of Muslims, make their advisors good, assist them to do every thing good, use them to make the right overcome, forsake falsehood, and assist them",

True Servants fully confirm all Allah's Names and Attributes, without Tamthil or Tashbih (comparison), and declare Him to be non­comparable to any of His creatures in all His Attributes without any Ta'til. They describe Allah with the Divine Names and Attributes mentioned in the Book and the authentic Sunnah, without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta'til, Takyif (questioning Allah's Attributes), Tamthil, or any addition or deletion. These are the true followers of the Messengers, not the Mubtadi' (those who introduce innovations in religion). They follow the upright Manhaj that was pursued by the Messengers and their followers in righteousness, at the head of whom was Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), his Sahabah (Companions, may Allah be pleased with them), and their followers in righteousness, at the head of whom were the well­known Imams (initiators of the Schools of Jurisprudence) after the Sahabah, such as Imam Malik ibn Anas, Imam Muhammad ibn Idris Al­Shafi'y, Imam Abu Hanifah Al­Nu'man ibn Thabit, Imam Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hanbal, Imam Al­Awza'y, Imam Sufyan Al­Thawry, Imam Ishaq ibn Rahawyah, and other the Imams of knowledge and guidance who followed the upright course of confirming the Names and Attributes of Allah and describing Allah as being unlike His Creatures.",

There is another duty on the part of the students of knowledge first before Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and then before their bothers, colleagues, and society; that they must be mindful and fearful of Allah in all their actions. As soon as they learn anything, they should hasten and apply it at once; they should not be lax, but must put into practice what they learn. Learning is a must and practicing what we learn is also a must. The seekers of knowledge call themselves to account for their actions all the time, and exert their best to apply Allah's Rulings to themselves. They regard the Wajib (obligatory) as obligatory for them to do and the Mustahab (desirable) as desirable for them to do, to be a living example of the knowledge they have in their morals, deeds, life, studying circles, sermons, travels, and residence, on land, sea or air; in fact everywhere. This is important not only for themselves, but to others, such as their brothers, colleagues, and students, to impart their knowledge to them through words and actions. This was the way of our Prophet's Da'wah; perfect preaching through words and actions. His life was the best of all lives, his words were the best after those of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and his manners were the best of all manners.
