Moreover, He (Glorified be He) created Jannah (Paradise) for His Awliya (the pious worshippers of Allah) who remain steadfast the good morals that He (Glorified be He) ordains and calls them for. Furthermore, He promised them Jannah and honor in the hereafter along with success and support for doing goodness in this life.

The best a servant can do is to believe sincerely that Allah is the One. It also means forsaking what Allah has forbidden.
