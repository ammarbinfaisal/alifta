I was devoted to Allah and hopeful of Allah's Reward, performing Salah (prayer) and Sawm (fast) and calling to Allah. I was jealous of the status of Muslims till I took part in Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) in Afghanistan. I promised Allah not to return till I achieved victory; but I became weak and returned in two months, upon the insistence of my parents. Then, my whole life changed to the extent that I doubt the existence of Allah and the authenticity of the Ever-Glorious Qur'an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). I pushed such thoughts away and searched in the tapes and books of Sheikh Al-Zandany and Al-Haqq (the Truth) appeared. Nevertheless, some doubts and insinuations still haunt me. The gravest disaster is that I do not feel fear of Allah in my heart. I constantly make Istighfar (seeking forgiveness from Allah) as I have been suffering from this for a year and half. I tried everything to make sure of Al-Haqq and dispel such doubts, but in vain. As soon as I begin to follow Al-Haqq for a time, I return to what I held. I used to fast the White Days (13th, 14th, and 15th of every Hijri month) and perform Tahajjud (optional late night Prayer), I still do this but I do not feel the joy.",

I find my heart heedless and impervious to Al-Haqq; I fear Allah's Anger over what I have done. I also give a quarter of my salary in charity for the Sake of Allah and take care of orphans. I am not affected by admonitions as before; I accuse myself of Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law), Fujur (wickedness, evil-doing) and sometimes Kufr (disbelief). I have tried every means, but still the doubts and insinuations destroy me and I cannot get rid of them.",

Rather, they should be taken to righteous people among the reciters of the Qur'an who are well­versed in the treatment of such cases. They can recite Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) over the patient, blow over them, and use beneficial, lawful means to exorcize them. Allah has made a reason for everything and a remedy for every ailment. Jinn (creatures created from fire) are mostly exorcized ­ with Allah's Will ­ when a pious, knowledgeable believer known for uprightness and sound `Aqidah (creed) recites recommended Ayahs over the possessed and blows over them while rebuking the Jinn. Under no circumstances should a Muslim ever go to such deviant Sufis who are notorious for their Bid`ah (innovation in religion), aberrations, and superstitions. A Muslim should neither visit them nor seek their treatment, for they may harm their visitors and drag them into their Bid`ah practices and superstitions. Sufis mostly resort to Bid`ah and superstitions, and most of them worship their so­called shaykhs along with Allah, seek their help, make vows to them, and invoke them for support, whether they are alive or dead. Thus, deviant Sufis are in a dangerous state and only few among them have been able to remain uncorrupted. There is neither might nor power except with Allah! May Allah grant us and them insight and guidance to the correct way of treating such cases, described in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). It is the way followed by the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him) and those who diligently follow in their footsteps. This is the Straight Path ­ that is, Allah's Din (religion of Islam) which was revealed to His Messenger (peace be upon him). Likewise, it is not permissible for any person, whether possessed or suffering other diseases, to seek treatment from sorcerers, charlatans, or soothsayers who claim knowledge of Ghayb (the Unseen), worship anyone other than Allah, and treat patients using unlawful means prohibited by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).",

They said as Allah tells about them in the Glorious Qur'an: These are our intercessors with Allâh. , We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.

On the contrary, if a grave is in a certain place and a Masjid is built over it, the Masjid should be demolished and removed, for it is the reason for the existence of Munkar. This is because the Messenger (peace be upon him) warned against building Masjids over graves, cursed the Jews and the Christians for doing so, forbade his Ummah (nation) to imitate them, and said to `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him): Spare no portrait unwiped out, and leave not a high grave unleveled.

In this regard, I inform you that the Kharijites were not the supporters of Imam `Aly; rather, they were his opponents. He fought against and killed a large number of them. They accused him of apostasy and considered it lawful to kill him (may Allah be pleased with him). Imam `Aly was killed by Ibn Muljim, who was one of them. The Kharijites were a wicked sect who considered a Muslim who commits sins to be a Kafir (disbeliever). They opined that disobedient Muslims will abide in Hellfire forever and that they will not come out of it; the same as disbelievers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned us against them and told us that they quickly pass through (the teachings of) Islam just like an arrow passes through prey. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was upright and trustworthy as other Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), according to the viewpoint of Ahl Al­Sunnah wal­Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community). Moreover, he was the Companion who memorized most of the Hadiths of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). Neither `Umar nor any other Companion accused him of belying. Rather, they quoted his Hadiths as evidence and acted in accordance with them. Thus, the mentioned author has committed a great sin by telling lies about the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Accordingly, one cannot depend on him or his book.

However, my father does not let me leave school. I want to leave this school and get away from this environment, and work in farming and worship Allah far away from the evil of people, but my father does not let me do this.
