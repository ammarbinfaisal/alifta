          "text": "but they were still unable to get out. The third one made Tawassul by virtue of his rendering back the trust. He said he had a trust left by some of his workers which he developed and increased until it became a great amount of wealth with camels, cows, sheep and slaves. When the worker returned, he gave him the entire amount and said, \"O Allah, if You know I did that only for Your Sake, remove the distress in which we are.\" The rock moved and they were able to get out of the cave. This Hadith shows that making Tawassul through good deeds makes the supplication more likely to be answered, while making Tawassul with the honor of Muhammad (peace be upon him), the honor of another person, the honor of Al­Siddiq, the honor of `Umar, the honor of `Aly, the honor of the Prophet's household or anyone is a Bid`ah that has no origin in religion. Lawful Tawassul can be made through Allah's Names and Attributes or through belief in Him, like saying, \"O Allah, I ask You by virtue of my belief in You,\" \"...my belief in Your Prophet)\" or \"...my love for You,\" or \"my love for Your Prophet\". All these forms are acceptable and are lawful ways of supplicating Allah (Exalted be He). In addition, someone may make Tawassul through their Tawhid such as saying, \"O Allah! I ask You bearing witness that You are Allah and there is no deity but You, the One and the Only\". It is also permissible to make Tawassul to Allah (Exalted be He) through being dutiful to parents, observing the performance of prayer and abstinence from committing Zina. All these means are lawful and supported by scholars and knowledgeable people in Basra. Making Tawassul by virtue of the honor of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the honor of another person or the status of someone is a Bid`ah and we have already explained that the majority of scholars have agreed on its impermissibility. Allah is the Grantor of success.",

Thus, the excuse due to ignorance cannot be applied to teachings of Islam made clear by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the Qur'an and that which has spread among Muslims, especially in matters related to `Aqidah (creed) and the principles of religion. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) sent His Prophet (peace be upon him) to explain to people their religion and clarify it to them. Indeed, he conveyed the message, showed the nation the reality of the religion, explained everything and left it on the Right Path. Moreover, in the Qur'an, there is guidance and light. Some teachings are Ma`lum minad­din biddarurah (well­established religious matters) and are spread among Muslims. If someone claims that Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and worshipping anyone other than Allah is not prohibited, that Salah (Prayer), fasting in Ramadan or Zakah are not obligatory or that Hajj is not obligatory for whoever can afford it, their claim will not be accepted on the basis of ignorance since they live among Muslims and these matters are known to everyone. They are Ma`lum minad­din biddarurah and are known to all Muslims, thus such people",

Similarly, someone may claim they do not know it is forbidden to do what Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) do, who visit the graves and call upon idols, supplicate, slaughter, or vow for them. Other Mushriks slaughter animals for idols, planets, trees, or stones. They may seek treatment or victory from the dead people, idols, jinn, angels, prophets or anyone. All of these practices are Ma`lum minad­din biddarurah to be major Shirk. Allah shows this fact in the Glorious Qur'an. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) remained in Makkah for thirteen years, during which he warned people against Shirk, apart from another ten years he spent in Madinah. He (peace be upon him) conveyed to people the obligation of worshipping Allah alone and recited to them the Qur'an in which Allah (Exalted be He) says: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. He (Glorified be He) says: You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). And He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him) He (Glorified be He) also says: So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh's sake only.

He should be informed about the place of residence of the concerned person who is accused of Sihr. We can then take legal action against him so that the court decides what is necessary.

Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih.The Prophet (may Allah's Peace and Blessings be upon him) also says: Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (evildoing) and killing him is Kufr (disbelief).\" (Agreed upon by Al­Bukhari and Muslim).The Prophet (may Allah's Peace and Blessings be upon him) also says to his Companions: Should I inform you about the greatest of the major sins? They said: Yes, O Allah's Messenger! He said: To associate others in worship with Allah and to be undutiful to one's parents, and I warn you against giving a false saying or witness. (Agreed upon by Imams Al­Bukhari and Muslim)..There is no doubt that invoking a curse upon one's parents is considered one of the worst forms of ingratitude. All Muslims, in general, and all children, in particular, must beware of such crime. They must all purify their tongues from it to save themselves from the Anger and Punishment of Allah (Exalted be He) and to preserve love and brotherhood among Muslims and between children and parents.

This authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) indicates the permissibility of killing harmful creatures, such as ants, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, and predators. However, if ants cause no harm, they are not to be killed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited killing ants, bees, hoopoes, and sparrow­hawks. This case only applies when they cause no harm.
