This was just to cooperate with the Saudi forces to defend the country, Islam, and Muslims. There is no harm in doing so, because this is a way of seeking help to ward off oppression and to save and protect the country from the evils of wicked people and the oppression and aggression of tyrants and aggressors. There is no harm in doing so as stated clearly by the scholars. Regarding what has been rumored by some Muslim minorities who believed the claims of Saddam and his lies about the U.S. imperial interference with the affairs and sanctities of Muslims, to the end of other false rumors; actually this is a fatal misconception rumored by the party of Saddam, which is a nationalistic, not an Islamic party. Even if such people were Muslims, it is obligatory to deter them from transgression even by seeking the help of some unbelievers, particularly when proposing peaceful means to ward off evil and protect the country. The Messenger (peace be upon him) sought the help of Safwan Ibn Umayyah at the battle of Hunayn to fight against the people of Al­Ta'if. Accordingly, seeking help from unbelievers against transgressors is permissible. What is impermissible is to support the unbelievers against Muslims. As for this situation, it is a protection of Muslims and their countries from outlaws, aggressors, and unbelievers. There is a difference between the two situations: if one supports unbelievers against Muslims, this means apostasy, which is impermissible and Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect). In the current case of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has sought the help of unbelievers to deter and prevent the aggressor ­ whether a disbeliever or a believer ­ from entering the country and violating the sanctities of Islam, this is a required and necessary matter because this is for protecting Muslims from whoever may harm them, whether being a disbeliever or a believer. It is obligatory upon the Iraqi leader to repent to Allah, give up the false opinions he adopts, abandon the party of (Al­Shaitan) Satan, commit himself to Islam, rule by it, and oblige Iraqi people to abide by it. We supplicate to Allah to grant him guidance.",

Iman refers to the belief that Allah is the Only One worthy of worship and to believe in all that which Allah revealed. In that sense, Iman is broader than Tawhid, which is derived from an Arabic root that means dedicating acts of worship exclusively to Allah. This emanates from the fact that a person believes that Allah (may He be Praised) is the One worthy of worship, since He is the Creator, the Provider, the Perfect in His Names, Attributes and Actions and the Disposer of all affairs. Therefore, He is truly worthy of worship. In other words, Tawhid means making acts of worship exclusive to Allah Alone and negating them from others. Iman, however, has a broader sense, because it encompasses Tawhid and sincerity to Allah as well as believing in all that He revealed",

It signifies the adherence to the explicit sense of a given text or doctrine without thinking about Ta`lil (logical and methodical reasoning) or depending on Qiyas (analogy). Scholars of this school of thought do not recognize Qiyas or Ta`lil. They formulate their opinions based on the literal meaning of the commands and prohibitions and totally overlook the rationale and the implicit meanings. For that reason, they were called Zhahiriyyah, because they adhere to the literal meanings without looking into the causes, rationale and Shar`y Qiyas that the Qur'an and Sunnah support. Nonetheless, their views in general are better than that of the people of Ra'y (personal opinion) who totally depend on reasoning and Qiyas and overlook the Shar`y proofs from the Qur'an and Sunnah. The Zhahiriyyah school of thought has some deficits and is condemned for their adherence to the literal meaning of the texts without considering the causes, rationale and the secrets that Allah or His Prophet cited and intended. Accordingly, they committed mistakes in many issues that the Qur'an and Sunnah supported.",

Some scholars held that this ruling was enforced during the early days of Islam, but later on it was abrogated by Allah's command to fight and perform Jihad. According to this opinion, a non­Muslim who refuses to embrace Islam must be fought until he either embraces Islam or pays the Jizyah if he meets its conditions. Thus, it is obligatory to oblige the disbelievers to accept Islam, if they are not among those who pay the Jizyah because their conversion to Islam brings about their happiness and salvation in the worldly life and the Hereafter.

Following in the footsteps of Messengers and their followers, no matter how long this takes, is better than any act that harms Da`wah, weakens it, or even destroys it. My advice to every caller to Allah is to use kindness in their speech, letters, all their attempts concerning Da`wah, and to observe mercy with every person unless they exceed the limits. There is no better way for Da`wah than that of the Messengers for they are the best model and the Imams. There was among them Nuh (Noah) who stayed among them a thousand years less fifty inviting them to Allah as well as Hud, Salih, Shu`ayb and Ibrahim (Ibraham).
