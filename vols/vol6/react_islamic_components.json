The same has to apply to clerks as well, so that every body is far removed from the means of Fitnah and prohibited Khulwah. Conforming with the foregoing will help you to accomplish the purpose for which human beings were created which is not just to eat, drink, fulfill sexual desires, and enjoy the pleasures of this world but to worship Allah Alone and fear Him by sincerely and devoutly obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions.",

So, if there is a fear of sickness and a person is vaccinated against an infection that is present in the country or elsewhere, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is a kind of protection. As the current disease is to be treated by medicine, so the feared disease is to be treated as well.

He said, There is no 'Adwa (no contagious disease is conveyed without Allah's permission), nor is there any bad omen (from birds), nor is there any Hamah i.e. a kind of birds that the Arabs used to see as a bad omen, nor is there any bad omen in the month of Safar, nor is there a star promising rain, or an ogre. This rejects the pre­Islamic beliefs that contagious diseases such as scabies are contagious by themselves and that anyone who mixes with the sick will be afflicted with the same sickness. This is false, as it occurs because Allah wills and ordains so. As it is known, the person may mix with the sick and they will not be afflicted. Thus, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about mixing the healthy camels and the camels afflicted with scabies, he replied that, Who infected the first one? With regard to his saying, One should run away from the leper as one runs away from a lion and the other report in which he narrated, The sick should not be brought to the healthy (i.e. the owner of a sick camel should not mix it with the healthy camels), they show that it is impermissible to believe that contagious disease transfers without Allah's permission.

On the other hand, it is impermissible for a person to shake hands with a non­Mahram woman, for a woman once outstretched her hand to shake the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he told her: I do not shake hands with women. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said: By Allah, the hands of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had never touched the hands of any woman, he only used to take their pledge of allegiance verbally (Peace be upon). Hence, it is impermissible for a woman to shake hands with non­Mahram men, as it is impermissible for a man to shake hands with non­Mahram women based on the two mentioned Hadiths. It is also feared that Fitnah (temptation) may occur as a result of this.",

He must believe in what Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) said about the states of the dead in their graves, as the grave is a garden of the gardens of Paradise, or one of the pits of Hell. Once the deceased is placed inside his grave, two angels ask him about his Lord, religion, and Prophet. For the believers, Allah (Exalted be He) would send down tranquility into their hearts and add faith to their faith. When asked in his grave, the believer would answer my Lord is Allah, Islam is my religion, and Muhammad (peace be upon him) is my Prophet. As the Muslim was holding fast to his faith and to his religion during his lifetime, for this reason Allah (Exalted be He) would grant him peace of mind and tranquility in his grave.",

As such, people would be resurrected and judged on the Day of Resurrection. When the trumpet sounds on the Last Day, all people will die and be resurrected and judged in accordance with their deeds. The Qur'an and Sunnah asserted that Israfeel will blow the Trumpet. At the first blowing, all people die and are resurrected after the second blowing. Then, they will rise from graves wherever they may be in the sea or whatever, to be gathered and judged in accordance with their deeds. All this must be believed in. One must prepare for that Last Day by the belief in the Oneness of Allah and following His ordinances and avoiding His disobedience. Afterwards, the balances will then be erected and the deeds will be weighed. The happy ones are those who are judged and given their records in their right hands, and the wretched are those people who are judged and given their records in their left hands. We ask Allah for safety.",

This test is also given to people to show those who seek and call for establishing the truth and those who do not. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned. This trial refers to testing people to distinguish the truthful from the liar, the pious from the wicked, and the good from the evil. This is also to let those whom Allah (Exalted be He) wills to be happy return to the truth while those whom He wills to be wretched keep to misguidance. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, And We tried them with good (blessings) and evil (calamities) in order that they might turn (to Allâh's Obedience). This Ayah points out that Allah (Exalted be He) may test people with times of ease and bounties including wealth, high rank, and others, and with evil which includes calamities, difficulty, eagerness, fear, warfare, and affliction so that they might return to the truth and adhere to guidance. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, And fear the Fitnah (affliction and trial) which affects not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong (but it may afflict all the good and the bad people), and know that Allâh is Severe in punishment.

The entire world therefore mobilized troops on the Saudi borders and exerted great effort to convince the Iraqi ruler to withdraw his troops from this country.

Some people think that it is better not to fight with either side. The same occurred during the first Fitnah which took place after the Prophet's (peace be upon him) death. It broke out between the peopel of the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) and the regions of Iraq because of the murder of `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). Those who had a grudge for Islam made their way into this Fitnah by means of stealth and the matter was completely chaotic. Owing to the unjust murder of `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), severe Fitnah took place. People pledged allegiance to `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him)",

This Fitnah is not one that should be deserted because the truth is clear. The basic rule is that only the imperspicuous Fitnah, in which the truth cannot be distinguished from falsehood, must be avoided. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, There will be afflictions (in the near future) during which a person who is sitting will be better than one who is standing, and the person who is standing will be better than one who is walking, and the person who is walking will be better than one who is running, and whoever exposes himself to these afflictions, they will destroy him. So whoever can find a place of protection or refuge from them, should take shelter in it. (Related in the two Sahih (authentic) books of Al­Bukhari and Muslimon the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)). He (peace be upon him) also said, Before the Last Hour there will be commotions like pieces of a dark night in which a man will be a believer in the morning and a disbeliever in the evening, or a believer in the evening and an disbeliever in the morning. He who sits during them will be better than he who gets up and he who walks during them is better than he who runs. So break your bows, cut your bowstrings, and strike your swords on stones.

He (Glorified be He) has warned against following one's own desires and obeying the enemies of Allah (Exalted be He) in ruling against His Shari`ah. He (Glorified be He) has also mentioned that His ruling is the best, and that all rulings that contradict His are of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of Ignorance). He (Glorified be He) has mentioned that ruling by what He has not revealed is Kufr (disbelief), Zhulm (injustice), and Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law), declaring that whoever does not make the Messenger (peace be upon him) judge in all his affairs, be inclined to this, and accept this with full submission will have no Iman. Hence, it is the duty of all Muslim rulers to abide by Allah's Ruling (Glorified be He), rule His servants according to His Shari`ah, and find in themselves no resistance to that. They should beware of following their desires that contradict His Shari`ah, or obeying anyone who calls to rule by any law or regulation opposing what is established by Allah's Book or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) of His Messenger (peace be upon him).

This was the hope of the Ummah despite all the serious events that were about to ruin its wealth, devastate the interests of its peoples, and threaten its Din (religion) strongly, and despite the bitter trials that the Ummah witnessed during the current century that led to the destruction of many parts of the Ummah's body. Nevertheless, the tyrant of Iraq killed such hope in Muslims' hearts by attacking Kuwait unjustly and continuously trying to increase reasons for dissension and disagreement amongst people of the Ummah to take it many years backwards. Thus, it is greatly important, under these challenges that the Ummah faces, to hold a conversation with His Eminence Shaykh `Abdul `Aziz Bin `Abdullah Ibn Baz, Chairman of the Departments of Scholarly Research, Ifta', Daw`ah, and Guidance. This is because such a conversation reflects the view of one of the most prominent scholars of the Ummah on the events it currently faces or has faced during this century. In this conversation, our eminent Shaykh observes the reality of the situation, defines the reasons and factors that led to the weakness that the Ummah suffers from, and tells about the effective remedy for getting rid of these burdens and worries that hinder its progress. `Ukazh thus introduces this comprehensive conversation that it held with the eminent Shaykh to shed light on all the foregoing along with some other points that concern Muslims nowadays:",

It is not a shame that a person returns to the truth; feuds and hostilities should not lead to damaging the public interests of Muslims. In fact, this results in unappreciated ends. Instead, Muslims should try their best to eliminate them through pardoning, forgiveness and reconciliation. The person who behaves badly should declare his repentance and offer excuses for his action, starting by replacing his misdeeds with good deeds since good deeds wipe out bad ones on the condition the doer is sincere. However, if a transgressor continues in his transgression and refuses reconciliation and cooperation, it is obligatory not to cooperate with him so long as such cooperation causes harm to the Islamic Da`wah or the Muslim society or leads to the corruption of morals.",

It is confirmed that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"You people present your cases to me and some of you may be more eloquent and persuasive in presenting their argument than others. If, as a result, I give someone's right to another, I am in fact giving them a piece of the Fire. They can either take it or leave it.\" (Agreed upon by Al­Bukhari and Muslimand it was related on the authority of Um Salamah, may Allah be pleased with her). The Hadith means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) could practice Ijtihad in judgments based on Shari`ah when there was no evidence revealed regarding them. Anyone who knew the judgment was not based on the truth and had presented false witnesses had indeed taken a piece of the Fire. They should beware of that and fear Allah, even if the judge was the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).",

So the claimant may bring false witnesses known to be trustworthy while he has no right, or he may know they are false witnesses while the judge considers them to be upright, for they fulfill the formal requirements of uprightness. In this case, the money, disputed item or the Qisas (retaliation), are not the claimant's right since he knows it is not and knows that he has transgressed and wronged the other. The right will not be lawful for the plaintiff even if the judge gives it to him, for a judge can only judges according to the facts and evidence presented. That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"If, as a result, I give someone's right to another, I am in fact giving them a piece of the Fire.\" Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) judged according to what Allah revealed to him and whenever a matter had no revealed text, he practiced Ijtihad, for his nation to follow his example.

May Allah protect us! It is related on the authority of Jundub ibn `Abdullah Al­Bajaly (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Allah has taken me as His Khalil (friend), as he took Ibrahim as His Khalil. If I am to take any one of my nation as a friend, I would take Abu Bakr as a Khalil. Those who were before you used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, so you should not take graves as places of worship; I forbid you to do that.\" (Related by Muslim in his \"Sahih\" Book of authentic Hadith)In this important Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade taking graves as places of worship and warned against it. He showed it was the practice of those before us who incurred Allah's Anger and those who went astray. It is a dispraised act, as it leads to Shirk and exceeds the proper limits in relation to prophets and righteous men. Therefore, it is not permissible for Muslims to build domes or places of worship over the graves of their dead, for this act is Munkar (unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and leads to Shirk. Consequently, it is not permissible to plaster, build over, and sit on the graves. It is related inMuslimon the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade these practices. In other Hadith, he (peace be upon him) forbade writing on graves and lighting them. The reason behind these prohibitions is to block the means leading to Shirk and to block the way of exceeding the proper limits. Moreover, sitting on the graves is an insult to their inhabitants. It is Allah Alone Whose help can be sought.",

In addition, rendering back trusts and sincerity in doing so are among the reasons for removing hardship and are among the righteous deeds. Due to the great importance of this account, the Prophet (peace be upon him) narrated it to his nation to benefit from it and learn good deeds from those who were before them. It is Allah Alone Whose help can be sought.",

The Prophet (peace be upon him) conveyed it by means of Da`wah in Makkah for thirteen years, then continued doing this in Al­Madinah before he was commanded to fight. Moreover, the Sahabah along with many Muslims had spread all over the earth and called to Allah, and had striven in His cause against whoever opposed them, for the sword is just a way. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war), as well as many benefits for mankind Allah (Exalted be He) also says: And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]. They fought those who refused for their own sake and safety. In general, whoever is indebted with any right to another should be obliged to fulfill this right either by jailing or beating, yet this person is unjustly treated. If this is the case, how can a person condemn or find it queer to oblige whoever is indebted to Allah to fulfill His Rights (Exalted be He)? Accordingly, with greater reason, the most important right and the worthiest of being fulfilled is the observance of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) to Allah (may he be Glorified) and the abandonment of associating others with Him. It is a Mercy from Allah (Glorified be He) to prescribe fighting and observance of Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) against Mushrikun (those who associate others in worship with Allah) so as to enforce them to single out Allah (Exalted be He) with worship and quit worshipping any thing other than Him. This leads to their happiness and safety in the worldly life and the Hereafter. Allah is the One Who grants success.",

I was very happy to know about your actions against the destructive principles and the harm you encountered because of that. In fact, this is the way of the messengers and their followers who are often tried but finally had the successful outcome. Thus, I recommend you to endure this patiently and have glad tidings. I reviewed the attached lecture entitled \"Our Position in the Methodology of Islam\" and found it generally good and fruitful. However, there are certain topics that look a little vague. For instance, in page number 3, it is written: \"Islam deems everyone separates himself from such a state and forms a new class or power centers, a disbeliever in Islam...\" We advise you to give attention to clarity and avoid generalization as much as you can when you prepare a lecture.",

I suggest that you work in the field of preaching and guidance in Kuwait and there is no blame on you at all to receive a salary for that type of work as you would take it for your work in teaching. Work in both fields, actually, involves calling to Allah, educating and instructing people, enjoining the Ma`ruf (that which is judged as good, beneficial, or fitting by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and forbidding the Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect). Also, there is no harm that a Muslim takes money from Bayt­u l­Mal (Muslim treasury) to help him continue his work in teaching, preaching, guiding, leading people in Salah (prayer), Adhan (call to Prayer), or any work of righteousness. Scholars differed as to the ruling of receiving a fee for teaching the Qur'an or leading people in Salah from someone other than Bayt­ul­Mal. In fact, the Companions of the Messenger (peace be upon him) received money from Bayt­u l­Mal that helped them to do acts of obedience to Allah and perform Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah). This took place during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the rightly­guided caliphs, though the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were the most prudent of people, who fear Allah most and know His laws best after the prophets. We have an excellent example in the Companions regarding this point. May Allah guide us all to what pleases Him! May Allah grant you, us and all Muslims understanding of Islam and steadfastness in it! Indeed, Allah is All­Hearer, Ever Near. As­salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.",

Resurrection is established). According to another narration, he (peace be upon him) said: \"They are unharmed by those who oppose them until the (Last) Hour comes to pass.\" In fact, movements that have recently spread all over the world and that call to following and applying the Qur'an and Sunnah show signs of what I have mentioned above. On the other hand, experience proved that these various ideologies such as western capitalism, communism, and all other trends that its followers propagate are false and fruitless. They harm humans in their religion, morals, and economy instead of bringing happiness to them.

Some of the sincere well­wishers wrote to me about a grave that is being worshipped instead of Allah in your village. Attached is a copy of his letter along with two photos of the said grave. I hope Your Eminence could issue an order to the undermining of this grave and preventing people from excessively praising it and offering sacrifices for its dweller. Excessiveness related to graves is an act of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance). Besides, drawing closer to the dwellers of graves by offering sacrifices or vows or seeking their help are acts of Jahiliyyah, which Muslim rulers should end. The mortal remains should be moved to the public cemetery; each corpse should be buried in a separate hole in the ground, and its surface should be leveled like all other graves in order to hide it from people, lest they should return to overpraising it again. It was reported that `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) did the same with the grave of Daniel that the Persians used to overparsie; he ordered them to dig thirteen graves during the daylight and to put the corpse in one of them at night to level all the graves so that people could not discern his grave. May Allah bless you wherever you are and make the religion victorious with your support! May Allah guide you to do that which He loves and that which pleases Him! May Allah help you protect the purified Shari`ah from contraventions! He is the Most Generous. As­salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh",

This is the original basis, unless an Islamic interest requires covert advice, for fear that some people may be too proud to accept open public advice. In this case, the advice should be in secret. The advisor and guide should seek the appropriate way to deliver advice; if advising, calling and helping in righteousness in public can benefit the attendants and provide public interest, he should do so. If the interest requires providing advice in secret, he should do so. The objective is to avail the one advised and the whole society; so whatever means can achieve this is required, whether in secret or in public. The advisor and caller to Allah are like the physician who seeks the appropriate time, quantity and quality. Likewise, the caller to Allah and advisor should seek what is most appropriate and beneficial.",

When the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) to Khaybar and asked him to invite the people to Islam, he said, \"By Allah, if even one person is guided through you, that will be better for you than possessing the most valuable camels.\" (Agreed upon by Imams Al­Bukhari and Muslim).The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said, If anyone calls others to follow right guidance, their reward will be equivalent to those who follow him (in righteousness) without their reward being diminished in any respect. If anyone invites others to follow error, their sin will be equivalent to that of the people who follow them (in sinfulness) without their sins being diminished in any respect.

This also includes the right of being a good neighbor. You should never harm your non­Muslim neighbors but you should give them charity if they are needy, present them with gifts, and advise them. This may be a cause of their being guided to Islam and as our neighbors have rights on us. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Jibril (Gabriel, peace be upon him) continued to recommend me about treating the neighbors kindly so much so that I thought he would give them the right of inheritance. (Agreed upon by Imams Al­Bukhari and Muslim).If the neighbor is a non­Muslim, they have the right of kind treatment. If they are relatives, they have a double right: the right of a neighbor and the right of kinship. It is permissible for a Muslim to give Sadaqah (voluntary charity), not Zakah, to a neighbor who is a Kafir, provided that they are not warriors. This is according to Allah's saying, Allâh does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allâh loves those who deal with equity. It is also reported in the Sahih Hadith on the authority of Asma' bint Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) that her mother came to her in Madinah seeking help at the time of the treaty of Al­Hudaybiyyah and she was a Mushrik (polytheist).

Concerning the claim that the Prophet (peace be upon him) committed sins, this is a false claim. This matter should be discussed in detail as we mentioned above. As for the statement of Imam Malik (may Allah be merciful with him): \"The views we think may be accepted or rejected except for what the occupant of this grave (i.e. the Prophet (peace be upon him))\" says; this is a correct statement that gained the scholars' acceptance. Imam Malik (may Allah be merciful with him) was one of the best Muslim scholars. He was Imam of Dar Al­Hijra (Madinah) at his time i.e. the second Hijra century. This statement attributed to him is correct and has gained the scholars' acceptance because every scholar can refute the views of other scholars who can refute his views in return. However, the Messenger (peace be upon him) said nothing but truth. Thus, his sayings cannot be refuted. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was truthful in all that he conveyed from Allah (Exalted be He), all that he confirmed, all that he ordered, and all that he called for.",

Whoever claims that this matter has to do with the affairs of this world, in accordance with this Hadith: You have better knowledge (of a technical skill) in the affairs of your life, is mistaken because the Messenger (peace be upon him) confirmed this and built on it a Shar`i ruling. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not say \"I think\", rather he confirmed and gave an order, which involves a binding legislation by the Prophet (peace be upon him) because he said: If a house fly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink) and then take it out, for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease.

I pushed such thoughts away and searched in the tapes and books of Sheikh Al-Zandany and Al-Haqq (the Truth) appeared. Nevertheless, some doubts and insinuations still haunt me. The gravest disaster is that I do not feel fear of Allah in my heart. I constantly make Istighfar (seeking forgiveness from Allah) as I have been suffering from this for a year and half. I tried everything to make sure of Al-Haqq and dispel such doubts, but in vain. As soon as I begin to follow Al-Haqq for a time, I return to what I held. I used to fast the White Days (13th, 14th, and 15th of every Hijri month) and perform Tahajjud (optional late night Prayer), I still do this but I do not feel the joy.",

It is obligatory upon scholars and Muslim rulers throughout the Islamic world to warn people against this Bid`ah. They should also renounce and prevent holding this celebration as an act of obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) and their duty to point out what is wrong to His Servants. They should explain to the people that honoring the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), the other messengers, and the righteous people is through following their footsteps, inviting people to what was ordained by Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), and warn them against anything that contradicts it. Scholars who are known for verifying and glorifying the Sunnah disapprove of and warn against these Mawlids. They declared that it is Bid`ah that has no origin in the purified Shari`ah and should not be allowed.",

Rather, they should be taken to righteous people among the reciters of the Qur'an who are well­versed in the treatment of such cases. They can recite Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) over the patient, blow over them, and use beneficial, lawful means to exorcize them. Allah has made a reason for everything and a remedy for every ailment. Jinn (creatures created from fire) are mostly exorcized ­ with Allah's Will ­ when a pious, knowledgeable believer known for uprightness and sound `Aqidah (creed) recites recommended Ayahs over the possessed and blows over them while rebuking the Jinn. Under no circumstances should a Muslim ever go to such deviant Sufis who are notorious for their Bid`ah (innovation in religion), aberrations, and superstitions. A Muslim should neither visit them nor seek their treatment, for they may harm their visitors and drag them into their Bid`ah practices and superstitions. Sufis mostly resort to Bid`ah and superstitions, and most of them worship their so­called shaykhs along with Allah, seek their help, make vows to them, and invoke them for support, whether they are alive or dead. Thus, deviant Sufis are in a dangerous state and only few among them have been able to remain uncorrupted. There is neither might nor power except with Allah! May Allah grant us and them insight and guidance to the correct way of treating such cases, described in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). It is the way followed by the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him) and those who diligently follow in their footsteps. This is the Straight Path ­ that is, Allah's Din (religion of Islam) which was revealed to His Messenger (peace be upon him). Likewise, it is not permissible for any person, whether possessed or suffering other diseases, to seek treatment from sorcerers, charlatans, or soothsayers who claim knowledge of Ghayb (the Unseen), worship anyone other than Allah, and treat patients using unlawful means prohibited by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).",

Consequently, many people committed Shirk and did exactly as had been done by people of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance) who worshiped idols such as Al­Lat, Al­`Uzza, Manat, etc.. They said as Allah tells about them in the Glorious Qur'an: These are our intercessors with Allâh. , We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh. To make it more clear, scholars mentioned that if a grave is placed in a Masjid, it is Wajib that the grave is exhumed and taken away from the Masjid. On the contrary, if a grave is in a certain place and a Masjid is built over it, the Masjid should be demolished and removed, for it is the reason for the existence of Munkar. This is because the Messenger (peace be upon him) warned against building Masjids over graves, cursed the Jews and the Christians for doing so, forbade his Ummah (nation) to imitate them, and said to `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him): Spare no portrait unwiped out, and leave not a high grave unleveled. I ask Allah to set right the affairs of all Muslims, bestow upon them the sound understanding of their Din (religion), set right their authorities, unify their word on righteousness, guide them to apply the rulings of Shari`ah, and beware of all that opposes it. Verily, Allah is the Most Bountiful, the Most Generous.",

Accordingly, whoever understands his religion by attending Halaqahs (learning circles) and contemplating the Qur'an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) can not be accused of following Satan. Rather, he is endeavoring to seek knowledge and attain much benefit. However, a knowledge seeker should adhere to scholars who are noted for their sound `Aqidah (creed) and conduct. He may ask them about whatever confuses him, for whoever does not resort to people of knowledge will tend to blunder and become extremely confused. But, if a person persists in attending the Halaqahs and listening to lessons from people of knowledge, they will achieve much benefit and welfare, even if they do not follow a particular shaykh. There is no doubt that whoever attends Halaqahs, listens to Friday Khutab (sermons), other Khutab delivered on different occasions, and lectures presented in Masjids (mosques) will be following many shaykhs, even if he is not affiliated to a specific one whom he patterns and follows.",

He should have advised him to hold fast to Allah [i.e. have confidence in Allah, and depend upon Him in all his affairs]. Concerning the advice given to the disciple by his Sheikh to remember him, this is one of the mistakes committed by extremist Sufis, who instruct their disciples and students to worship them beside Allah (May He be Exalted), to seek their help, and to trust them in fulfilling their needs and dispelling their distress. This act falls under Al­Shirk­ul­Akbar (major form of associating others in worship with Allah). We seek refuge with Allah from this.

In this regard, I inform you that the Kharijites were not the supporters of Imam `Aly; rather, they were his opponents. He fought against and killed a large number of them. They accused him of apostasy and considered it lawful to kill him (may Allah be pleased with him). Imam `Aly was killed by Ibn Muljim, who was one of them. The Kharijites were a wicked sect who considered a Muslim who commits sins to be a Kafir (disbeliever). They opined that disobedient Muslims will abide in Hellfire forever and that they will not come out of it; the same as disbelievers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned us against them and told us that they quickly pass through (the teachings of) Islam just like an arrow passes through prey. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was upright and trustworthy as other Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), according to the viewpoint of Ahl Al­Sunnah wal­Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community). Moreover, he was the Companion who memorized most of the Hadiths of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). Neither `Umar nor any other Companion accused him of belying. Rather, they quoted his Hadiths as evidence and acted in accordance with them. Thus, the mentioned author has committed a great sin by telling lies about the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Accordingly, one cannot depend on him or his book. This book should be burnt, if the case is as you have mentioned.",

The act of Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is to extend and return the Salam (Islamic greeting of peace) in words. Greeting with a wave of the hand is not permissible, because it is an imitation of some Kafirs (disbelievers) who do this, and because it is contrary to what is prescribed by Allah. However, if a person waves to one whom he is greeting to indicate that he is saying Salam, because he is far away, whilst also uttering the words of the Salam [As­salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah's Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)], there is nothing wrong with that, because there is evidence to that effect. Similarly, if the person who is greeted is busy offering Salah (Prayer), he may respond with a gesture, as was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him).",

Such act is rewarded for it is an act of kindness, even if the one rescued is a Kafir. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: and do good. Truly, Allâh loves Al­Muhsinûn (the good­doers). He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: Allâh does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allâh loves those who deal with equity. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah continues to help His Servant as long as the servant helps his brother. He (peace be upon him) also said: Whoever fulfills the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs. These two Hadith are related to Muslims. It was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al­Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of Asma' bint Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) allowed her to keep good relations with her Kafir mother at the time of the truce that took place between the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the people of Makkah. Concerning combatant Kafirs, it is not permissible to help them in any way; rather, helping them is one of the acts which nullifies Islam.

They do not obey the Commands of Allah or avoid His Prohibitions even though He has bestowed upon them wealth and other blessings. Another meaning is also suggested that they wear clothes that do not cover them, for being too light or too short. Thus, they do not serve their purpose. Hence, they are described as \"naked\", as the clothes they wear do not cover their 'Awrah (private parts of the body that must be covered in public). Over and above, \"Inclined\" means deviant from chastity and righteousness i.e. they commit sins and evil deeds like those who do immoral acts or fall short to perform the obligatory duties, prayer, etc. As for the interpretation of \"Inclining\", it means that they misguide others i.e. they call people to evil and corruption. So, they lead others to immorality and sin by words and deeds. They commit immoral actions because of their weak or fading Iman (faith/belief). This Sahih Hadith intends to warn against wrongdoing and all kinds of corruption whether committed by men or women.",

Similarly, the rest of the Messengers, the Mu'minun (believers), the angels, and children, for they will all intercede by Allah's Will. Allah will accept their intercession for whomsoever He wills among the people of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) who have entered hellfire by their sins, but are Muslims. Then, there will remain in hellfire those sinners who are not included in the intercession of the intercessors, but Allah will bring them forth by His Mercy and Grace.

He told them that when Khadijah, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died, he slaughtered a camel and accepted condolences for three days. He claimed this was mentioned in the Hadith of Qatadah. He mentioned another Hadith without specifying the source narrator stating that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"I am a tree whose trunk is `Aly, whose branch is Fatimah, and whose fruits are Al­Hasan and Al­Hussayn.\" He mentioned a third Hadith that states that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was once walking in the mountains of Makkah when he met a Jewish man. He asked him, \"Have you not believed in me yet?\" The Jew replied, \"No.\" He said to him, \"Ask this tree to come.\" The Jew said, \"Muhammad asks you to come.\" So, the tree came to him covering him with its shade. He asked it, \"Who am I?\" The tree replied, \"You are Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.\" The Jew then pronounced the two Shahadahs (Testimonies of Faith). The tree then ascended to the heavens; it circumambulated around `Arsh (Allah's Throne), Kursy (Allah's Chair) and Al­Lawh­ul­Mahfuzh (the Preserved Tablet); and it asked Allah for permission to invoke peace and blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him). He (peace be upon him) asked the Jew to kiss his hands and his feet. Another tale states that `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) saw a man circumambulating around the Ka`bah, so he said to him, \"You have committed Zina (adultery).\" The man asked, \"How did you know that?\" He said, \"I saw it in your eyes.\" The man said, \"I have not committed Zina, but I looked at a Jewish woman (lustfully).\" He asked `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), \"Did you know this through Wahy (Revelation)?\" He replied, \"No, it is just a Mu'min's (believer) insight.\" When that preacher was asked for pieces of evidence on these tales, his supporters attacked us.

Some scholars held the view that doing so is Haram (prohibited) just as the case with regard to whoever is Junub (in a state of major ritual impurity). Such scholars proceeded by saying that since it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that a Junub is not permitted to recite Qur'an, the same applies to women in their menses and postpartum period because they are all different forms of Janabah (major ritual impurity related to sexual discharge). Consequently, menstruating women or those in postpartum period may not recite Qur'an until they become pure. In support of their view, the advocates of this opinion also quoted the Hadith which is related by Al­Tirmidhy on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that he said: A menstruating woman or a junub may not recite anything from the Qur'an .",

The period of Janabah however, is short, and unlike a menstruating woman or she who is having postpartum period, a junub person can immediately perform Ghusl then recite Qur'an. Accordingly, the most proper of the two opinions of scholars is that which states the permissibility for menstruating women or those who are in postpartum period to recite what they have memorized from the Qur'an. It is permissible for them to recite Ayat­ul­Kursy when they go to bed. Moreover, it is permissible for them to recite by heart whatever they like from the Qur'an at any time. This is the most proper opinion and the original ruling and thus when `Aishah menstruated during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet (peace be upon him) instructed her saying: Do what all the pilgrims do except that you do not perform the Tawaf 'circumambulation' round the Ka'ba till you are purified and he (peace be upon him) did not forbid her to",

There are clear texts that a Junub person is not allowed to recite Qur'an. This is because Janabah does not last for long and a person can immediately perform Ghusl and recite Qur'an. It was the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he used to continue making Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) at all times. Only when he (peace be upon him) was Junub, would he stop reciting Qur'an until he (peace be upon him) had performed Ghusl. `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: There was nothing to hinder the Prophet (peace be upon him) from (reciting) Qur'an except being in the state of Janabah. Finally, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited Qur'an after defecating and said: \"This is permissible for whoever is not in Janabah. A person who is Junub is allowed to recite Qur'an or even one Ayah (Qur'anic verse) of it.\" This is proof that a Junub person is",

The correct view is that the site in Egypt is not his grave, rather that is a mistake and the head of Al­Husayn is not there. A number of scholars have written essays on that and explained that there is no evidence for the head of al­Husayn being in Egypt. The most likely view to be correct is the view that it is in Al­Sham, because it was taken to Yazid ibn Mu`awiyah who was in Al­Sham. There is no basis for the view that it was taken to Egypt.

Visiting graves to supplicate to dead people or beseech their help or intercession is a reprehensible action and indeed it is major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). It is not permissible to build mosques or domes over graves, because the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: \"May Allah curse the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.\" (Agreed upon by Imams Al­ Bukhari and Muslim) It is authentically narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade plastering of graves, sitting on them, and building over them. So it is not permissible to plaster over graves, perfume them, place screens around them or build over them; all of that is forbidden and these are means that lead to Shirk. And we should not pray at the graves, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you should not take graves as Masjids (mosques); I forbid you to do that. [Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book on the authority of Jundub ibn `Abdullaah Al­Bajaly(may Allah be pleased with him)] This Hadith indicates that it is not permissible to pray at the graves or to take them as Masjids, because this is a means to Shirk and worshipping someone other than Allah by calling upon them (the occupants of the graves), seeking their help, making vows to them, and touching their graves to seek their blessings. Hence the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against that. Rather graves should be visited in the manner prescribed in Shari`ah (Islamic law) only, to give Salam to them and make Du`a' for them and pray for them to have mercy without traveling specifically for that purpose.

Whoever does Isbal, not out of pride, has in fact committed an act which is a means to pride, because the means have the same ruling of objectives. Also, Isbal denotes extravagance and subjects clothes to dirt.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) means that the one who holds his garment when it slips down is not regarded as a person who makes Isbal out of pride, because this is done unintentionally and he tries to prevent this by holding it whenever it slips down. Definitely, such a person is excused. On the other hand, if a person intends to make Isbal, whether of Bisht (cloak), trousers, or shirts, he is included in the threat and has no excuse for doing so. This is because the Sahih Hadiths on the prohibition of Isbal are applicable to him, whether by their wordings or meanings. Accordingly, all Muslims must beware of Isbal, fear Allah, and take care not to lower their garments below their ankles, to act in accordance to these Sahih Hadiths and be cautious of Allah's Anger and Punishment.

All these benefit the dead and the living. It is authentically narrated from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) that he was asked whether a woman whose son gives charities on behalf of her after her death will receive a reward. He answered in the affirmative. It is narrated in Sahih Muslim(may Allah be merciful with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon) said: When a man dies, his acts come to an end but three: a recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (i.e. for the deceased). In conclusion, giving Sadaqah on behalf of the deceased is beneficial to him or her according to the consensus of Muslim scholars. The same applies to supplicating Allah (Exalted be He) for him. Thus, such a person can slaughter an animal on behalf of his father, grandfather, or any other person, whether intending to offer it as charity or as a sacrifice to be slaughtered throughout the four days of `Eid­ul­Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) to draw them nearer to Allah (may He be Praised and Glorified).

There is no harm in doing so. There is a reward for the dead as well as the person offering the sacrifice according to the degree of his sincerity to Allah (Exalted be He) and the lawfulness of his earnings. On the contrary, if such a person does so intending to draw nearer to the dead as done by those sacrificing for the dead, the sun, the moon, or Jinn, then this is an act of major Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah), because it is not permissible for any one to draw near to any person through slaughtering, vowing, or any other act of worship exclusively confined to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Say (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ): \"Verily, my Salât (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allâh, the Lord of the 'Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). \"He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.\" Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) Al­Kauthar (a river in Paradise). Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only). The Prophet (Peace be upon him) also says: \"Allah has cursed the one who slaughters (a sacrifice) to other than Allah…\" Narrated by Muslimin his Sahih. Thus, slaughtering for the Jinn, the dead, or other creatures, such as idols, planets, and the like, whether the slaughterer hopes for their intercession, believes that they benefit or save him from illness, or the like is legally unacceptable and Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah). The one who slaughters on behalf of one's father or grandfather believing that they can benefit him, cure an ill relative, or draw one near to Allah is like a person who slaughters for the sun, the moon, or the stars. All such acts are Shirk. We implore Allah to grant us safety.",

This is because they all mislead from the Path of Allah, harden the hearts, and distract people from listening to the Glorious Qur'an. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) told us that this leads to Dalalah (deviation from what is right) and misguidance of others, and is a cause of spreading pride and turning people away from listening to the Qur'an. If the heart becomes used to listening to music and watching singers it will harden and will be barred away from Al­Haqq (the Truth), except those whom Allah protected. It also distracts from obedience to Allah and His Messenger and from listening to the Qur'an and useful speeches. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Singing grows the seeds of hypocrisy in the heart as water grows the crops.\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Verily, among my Ummah (nation based on one creed) there will be people who will deem as lawful: Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), silk, Khamr (intoxicants) and musical instruments.\" (Related by Al­Bukhari in his \"Sahih [Book of Authentic Hadith] as Hadith Mu'allaq [a Hadith missing link in the chain of narration, reported directly from the Prophet]) and he confirmed it.The above Hadith informs us that at the end of time there will be people who will deem musical instruments and songs as lawful, although they are Haram.",

However, it does not nullify Wudu' (ablution). As for Salah (Prayer), its validity is debatable, for the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) holds the view that an intoxicant is Najis (ritually impure), consequently, the Salah of the one who offers it while deliberately having Najasah (ritual impurity) on the body and is aware of the ruling is not valid. Some scholars hold the view that the intoxicant does not cause Najasah. Thus, it comes to be known that the person who offers Salah with an intoxicant on their clothes or body while forgetting or ignorant of the ruling or thinking it is Tahir (ritually pure), their Salah is valid. However, to be on the safe side, they should wash off what is on their clothes or body in order to avoid the difference in scholars' opinion. If there is a kind of cologne that does not cause intoxication, it is not Haram to use it, since the `Illah (effective cause) given for a ruling exists, the ruling should be applied and vice versa.",

However, the rulers should not appoint sinners as Imams (those who leads congregational Prayer) while there are others to undertake this job. This is the right thing to do. This sinner is a Muslim and knows that Salah is obligatory, so the Salah of those behind him is valid. The supporting evidence on this is what was authentically established in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said about offering Salah behind corrupt leaders, They will lead you in Salah; if they offer it properly, the reward is for both of you; and if they offer it improperly, the reward is for you and the sin is for them. Other Hadiths that stress the same meaning were also reported from him (peace be upon him). Some of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) offered Salah behind Al­Hajjaj, who was one of the most corrupt people of his time. The Mu'mins (believers) should offer Salah in congregation, even if the Imam is a corrupt person. However, if they can offer Salah behind a just Imam, it will be better for their religion.",

As for my own view, at present I am not sure of either opinion, but I recommend being on the safe side, so it is better not to do that, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. The Prophet (may Allah's Peace and Blessings be upon him) also says: Whoever guards himself against doubtful things keeps his religion and honor blameless...

He cast His sight upon it again and it melted and trembled in awe of the Lord. Then, He looked at it for a third time and it became water and the fourth time half of it became solid. Allah created the Throne out of one half and created water out of the other half, then He left it in that state. Hence, it trembles till the Day of Resurrection.'\" Another narration reads: \"It is reported that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Those who hold the Throne are four angels. Each of them has four faces. Their feet are planted on a rock under the seventh firmament of the earth at a distance of a five hundred year journey.'\" Please enlighten me about the authenticity of what I have read!",
