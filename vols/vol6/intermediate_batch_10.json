Otherwise, he should be killed according to the most correct opinion among the scholars. When he refuses to pay Zakah and fights Muslims due to it, he should be fought as the Companions of the Prophet fought the withholders of Zakah under the banner of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). They judged them as apostates. In case he does not fight for it, the Imam (ruler) should force him to hand it over and apply a discretionary punishment on him to deter him. Thus, a Muslim is required to fast Ramadan, visit Al­Bayt (the House: another name for the Ka`bah), and abide by all ordinances which Allah enjoins on him. He is also asked to avoid what Allah forbids, because embracing Islam entails. Whoever violates something of what Allah has prescribed or commits something that Allah has forbidden, he shall have his due judgment according to the Shari`ah. If a non­Muslim just utters the two testimonies of faith while he is a disbeliever as done by most disbelievers these days, they are asked to leave all actions of disbelief. It is not enough to utter the two testimonies of faith, because he may keep saying it during his disbelief but he does not act accordingly.
