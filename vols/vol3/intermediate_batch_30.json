The other Madh­hab, however, is that of the discreditable Khalaf, namely, the Madh­hab of the people of Ta'wil, Tahrif (distortion of the meaning) and charlatanism. However, disproving and warning against the Madh­hab of the Khalaf does not necessarily entail declaring them to be disbelievers, since such declaration (Takfir) implies another ruling that is based on cognizance of the (denounced) person's saying, what he assumes of falsehood and the extent of his opposition to what is right. Hence, it is impermissible to claim that condemnation of the Madh­hab of the Khalaf or repudiation of Al­Asha`irah's mistake of allegorical interpretation of the Attributes or their distortion of their meanings (with the exception of few Attributes, which they excluded), necessarily entail declaring them to be disbelievers. Rather, the purpose is to expose their disagreement with Ahl­ul­Sunnah in this regard and the invalidity of the allegorical interpretation of the Khalaf, and to explain that the right approach is the Madh­hab of the righteous Salaf, namely Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama`ah, which acknowledges the verses and Hadith on Attributes just as they are mentioned and affirms their contents of the Names and Attributes in the way that befits Allah (Exalted be He) without distortion, denial, allegorical interpretation, questioning or comparison, as is frequently mentioned above. After all, Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then, he quoted the words of Al­Bayhaqy in this regard (already referred to), and said that he (Al­Bayhaqy, may Allah be merciful with him) was deceived by some of the jargon of the innovators (in religion), deeming it to be true, and in turn he introduced them in his book. He also claimed that Al­Bayhaqy was among those who engaged in Al­Kalam (a discipline that searches for answers to creedal issues using logic), and commented that he believes in some of its evil conclusions (may Allah forgive and pardon him). Here, Shaykh­ul­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) pointed out to the denotations of such claims in Al­Fatawa (vol. 6, p. 53).",

They also interpreted Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. claiming that His accompaniment of them is by His Knowledge, so that the (Divine) Self would not be (regarded as) multiple. Likewise, we will judge the hafizh Ibn Kathir as aberrant because he commented on Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, But We (i.e. Our angels who take the soul) are nearer to him than you, but you see not, (Tafsir At­Tabarî) '(It means) Our angels are nearer to Him than you but you do not see them'. He also interpreted Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge). as, 'It means: Our angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein', while immanentism is unanimously refuted.

Furthermore, what he mentioned about the Salaf as regards their interpretation of Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, And He is with you (by His Knowledge) that it means \"by His Knowledge\", is not an allegorical interpretation. Rather, it is the meaning of the verses \"on being in the company of Allah\" in the sight of Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama'ah as related by Imam Abu `Umar ibn `Abdul­Barr and Abu `Umar Al­Telamnaky that Ahl­ul­Sunnah unanimously agree to this view because it is affirmed by the related texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, which indicate Allah's Highness, Sublimity, and being far above immanentism. Thus, whoever contemplates the verses related to the present issue would perceive that the meaning of (Allah's) company is His encompassment of His Slaves' affairs and circumstances, while 'the special company' refers to His preservation, protection, safeguarding, and support of His prophets and Awliya', as well as His encompassment of their circumstances. Undoubtedly, the Arabs ­ upon whom the Book was sent down and in whose language the Sunnah was expressed ­ are acquainted with this meaning. As it was not ambiguous to them, they did not ask the Prophet (peace be upon him) about the meaning of such verses. Rather, it was crystal clear for them. However, the other texts need no allegorical interpretation since their meanings are clear, such as Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, Floating under Our Eyes , in order that you may be brought up under My Eye. and, So wait patiently (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) for the Decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes For, none could ever imagine that the ship floats with Allah's Eye or that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is in Allah's Eye. Rather, it means that the ship floats through Allah's protection, preservation, safeguarding of and subjecting it, and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is sheltered by His Lord's preservation, protection, and guardianship. This also applies to Allah's saying about Musa (Moses) in order that you may be brought up under My Eye. i.e. under My Preservation and Protection. This is also the case with the Hadith (in which Allah says), I would become his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees which is explained through His saying in",

Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) intended to demonstrate through it that He guides His Awliya' and directs their sense and moves to the right because of their obedience to Him and performance of their religious duties. Other Hadith also carry this meaning. As for the Hadith, The Black Stone is Allah's Right Hand. it is a Da`if (weak) Hadith, which is narrated from Ibn `Abbas (without being attributed to the Prophet, peace be upon him) and its meaning is clear, whether it is Marfu` (a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with a connected or disconnected chain of narration) or Mawquf (words or deeds narrated from a Companion of the Prophet that are not attributed to the Prophet). It is also narrated in the same Hadith: It is as if he had shaken hands with Allah and kissed His Right Hand. which indicates that the Stone is not the Right Hand of Allah.
