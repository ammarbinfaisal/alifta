They only have to repent to Allah (Exalted be He) sincerely from their previous negligence and slackness in fulfilling the due rights of Allah and His Servants, take a sincere oath to believe in Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), apply the Shari`ah, hold fast to the Rope of Allah and fight the enemies as one hand with every power Allah has granted them. Moreover, they should abandon the principles which oppose the Law of Allah and the essence of His religion, rely on Allah (Exalted be He) and no one else from the eastern or western camp, believe that every matter has a means to be materialized and prepare every possible power by all permissible means of Shari`ah. They should also be independent, impartial to all the non­Muslim blocs from the east and the west, and be distinguished by believing in Allah and His Messenger, adhering to His religion and holding fast to His Shari`ah.Regarding weapons and different types of equipment, it is permissible to possess them by every possible way and every possible means in conformity with Purified Shari`ah (Law).",
