What is meant by the ruler is a judge or any other official, i.e., all those who can serve an interest to the briber; whether they are rulers, governmental employees or those achieving special tasks such as commission agents, companies, real estate owners, etc. Judging in favor of the briber and inducing the bribed person to do what the briber wants is to fulfill the desire and purpose of the briber, whether right or wrong.",
