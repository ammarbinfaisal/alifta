Moreover, many of them thought they would keep their high position, great status, and supremacy over the weak by adhering to such worship. Hence, they strongly attempted to defend their gods and worship, fabricated many lies against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and urged people to turn away from him.",

The Prophet (peace be upon him) continued to call them to Allah, discuss with them, recite the Ever­Glorious Qur'an to them, guide them to the truth that Allah sent him with it and proclaim openly Allah's Message as he was commanded. Hence, the message of Islam spread in Makkah and was known to the Arabs and many other people in the countryside and cities. Many delegations came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) secretly to hear from him about Islam. This became apparent to the people of Makkah, who set out to harm the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions severely. History relates the stories of many Companions who were tortured by being exposed to oppressive heat and by many other ways. When the persecution and oppression became severer on the Prophet's Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all), the Prophet (peace be upon him)",
