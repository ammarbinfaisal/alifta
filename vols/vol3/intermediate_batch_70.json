Rather, it is likely that the wording involves distortion, as is stated by Ibn `Abdul­Bar (may Allah be merciful with him), and that the correct wording is \"By Allah, he shall succeed if he were true (to what he professed).\" It, thus, could be that some scribes or narrators distorted the original wording or that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that before the proscription of swearing by other than Allah (Exalted be He) was revealed. Anyway, this is a Shadh single narration, and it is not permissible for the one who believes in Allah and in the Day of Resurrection to hold by it and contradict the Hadith Sahih that clearly indicate the prohibition of swearing by other than Allah and that it is a forbidden act that is tantamount to Shirk.",

          "text": "This Hadith indicates that hastening to perform righteous deeds is a way of keeping one's faith steadfast; the absence of which is a factor of casting doubts and being afflicted with trials. These trails include lower desires, doubts and war. Most dangerous of all is succumbing to one's lower desires, which weak souls are most inclined to. A believer may be tricked and gradually sink into immoral acts leading to the loss of faith. The way to salvation and safety is to distance oneself from the ways that lead to such temptations, to be on guard as much as possible, and to diligently ask Allah for steadfastness in faith. One must also recite the Qur'an and meditate on its Ayahs which guide us to Allah and contain rational evidence and theoretical proofs of the existence and oneness of Allah, His sovereignty, His worth of being glorified, His Shari`ah worth of being followed, and His limits that should not be transgressed. Once Iman is deep­rooted hearts can taste its beauty, become enlightened by evidence, and it becomes difficult to be uprooted or replaced with any alternative.

The Caesar then said, \"This is what happens when the light of faith touches hearts.\" Reality attests to the statement of the Caesar. This is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not deny this statement. As for the practical application of this, Ibn Al­Qayyim in his poem, Al­ Nuniyyah, mentioned that he experienced some unrest and doubt because of his examination of the books of `Ilm­ul­Kalam (a discipline that searches for answers to creedal issues using logic) and their doubtful matters till he met Shaykh­ul­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah who guided him to the Ayahs and Hadith leading to knowing Allah, His glorious perfection, His Names and His complete sovereignty. This prompted him to rectify his faith and put an end to all his doubts. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.",
