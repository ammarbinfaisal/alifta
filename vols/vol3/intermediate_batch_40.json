          "text": "As for the examples quoted by fellow Al­Sabuny that refer to Ta'wil with Ahl­ul­Sunnah, they bear no argument in this point. The sayings of quoted scholars does not involve Ta'wil but explanation of the meaning and removal of confusion for some people, as regards their meanings. As for, Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. forgetting here does not really mean that mentioned in Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, and your Lord is never forgetful or in His (Exalted be He) saying, in a Record. My Lord neither errs nor He forgets. It has a meaning different form the affirmed forgetting. Forgetting is affirmed in Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. means He (Exalted be He) left them in their aberration and abandoned them because they neglected His Commands and turned away from His religion due to their hypocrisy and denial. The kind of forgetting that is disaffirmed for Allah (Exalted be He) is that which denotes amnesia and oblivion; for Allah (Exalted be He) is far above such forgetting due to His Perfect Omniscience and Encompassing Knowledge of all the affairs and conditions of His slaves. Indeed, He is the Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists; no slumber or sleep overtakes Him. May He be Glorified and Exalted above all this. Thus, it becomes clear that explaining forgetting to mean abandonment in Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, The hypocrites, men and women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Munkar (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islâm has forbidden), and forbid (people) from Al­M a' rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allâh's Cause) alms.]. They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. does not involve Ta'wil. Rather, it is a way of interpreting 'forgetfulness' in this context through its linguistic meaning, since \"Nisyan\" (forgetfulness) is a word that has multiple connotations and thus, its meaning differs according to its context, as explained by scholars of",

Thus, Allah's (Exalted be He) mocking at the mockers was equitable, and so was His plotting (planning) against the plotters, and scoffing at the scoffers. Moreover, what is equitable is also incomplete, and such actions are attributed to Allah (Exalted be He) because He (Exalted be He) did it in a way that befits His Majesty and Glory and that is in no way similar to the actions of the creatures. In addition, His (Exalted be He) enemies committed these actions in opposition to, disbelief in, and repudiation of the truth, so Allah (Exalted be He) rewarded them in a manner that does not resemble theirs and that is known to none other than Him (Exalted be He). Indeed, Allah willed not injustice to them, but they did injustice to themselves. Among Allah's planning against, plotting and mocking at them is giving a respite to them, granting them a delay, and deferring punishment from them. This includes the light that He shows the hypocrites on the Day of Judgment and then deprives them of it, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says inSurah Al­Hadid, On the Day when the hypocrites ­ men and women ­ will say to the believers: \"Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!\" It will be said: \"Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!\" So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.\" (The hypocrites) will call the believers: \"Were we not with you?\" The believers will reply: \"Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations, you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted (in Faith) and you were deceived by false desires, till the Command of Allâh came to pass. And the chief deceiver (Satan) deceived you in respect of Allâh.\"",

The Shaykh interpreted the Saying of Allah (whose meanings translated as): The Hand of Allâh is over their hands. He said that this Ayah has more than one meaning. It can be Allah's Help given to them, Allah's Power with them, or Allah's Knowledge of their conditions and intentions. After the seminar finished, one brother told the Shaykh that his interpretation of this Ayah goes against `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and complies with the views of Asha`irah (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic). The Shaykh was annoyed and replied that Al­Mawardy and Ibn Kathir mentioned this interpretation in their books. The man corrected him saying that Ibn Kathir did not state that, but it is Al­Mawardy who advocated Asha`irah. The debate heated and people behaved aggressively labeling the man a Christian and Buddhist and they were about to beat him but some protected him. Allah knows that this man wanted to explain the truth out of his jealousy for the Muslim `Aqidah and the impermissibility to delay the declaration beyond the time of need. The man suggested that the issue be referred to you and they agreed. Would you please enlighten us. May Allah reward you the best. Waiting for your reply.",

Discussing the Attributes comes under the heading of discussing the Divine Self. Whatever is said about the Divine Self, the same can in all respects be said about the Divine Attributes. If the Self is affirmed to exist without descriptive designation, the same applies to the Attributes. We affirm the existence of every Attribute without describing its manner. We say that Allah (Exalted be He) has a Hand and Eyes, but we do not say that His Hand implies Power and His Hearing implies having knowledge. Then he (may Allah be merciful to him) quoted as evidence affirming Allah's Attribute of having a Hand the following Ayah: The Jews say: \"Allâh's Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).\" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills. Allah (Exalted be He) also has said to Iblis (Satan): What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands. He (Glorified be He) also says: They made not a just estimate of Allâh such as is due to Him.

Also, Allah (Exalted be He) will grasp the earth and fold the heavens in His Right Hand and that His both Hands are widely outstretched.
