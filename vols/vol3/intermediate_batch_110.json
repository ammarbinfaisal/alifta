Would that our countries were like the Muslim countries endowed with decency, chastity, and purity where the maid and the slave enjoy the most luxurious ways of life and are treated kindly just as children! It is disgraceful for our country of England that it makes its young women an example of vice through their frequent mingling with men. How come then we do not tread in the heels of them (Muslim countries) by assigning for girls the work that suits their natural disposition such as domestic chores, and leave men's work for men so that we could preserve the honor of such girls.\"",
