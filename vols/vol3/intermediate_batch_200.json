In his Fatawa he said, \"As for deeming listening to songs permissible, it should be known that listening to a combination of tambourine, flute and singing sounds is impermissible according to the Imams of the four Madh­habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) as well as other Muslim scholars. Actually, it was not proven that any of the scholars who are known for their considerable opinion, as far as consensus and dispute is concerned, judged listening to such sounds to be permissible. However, some of Al­Shafi`y's disciples are reported to have differed on the permissibility of the sound of flute alone and that of tambourine alone. Therefore, those with weak mental faculties might think that Shafi`i scholars differed regarding listening to a combination of sounds made by such instruments. However, thinking as such is a fatal error as it leads to bad consequences denounced by Shar`y (Islamic legal) and rational evidence as differences of opinion may not, in all case, be a reliable base for action. Actually, if someone pursues areas of difference among scholars targeting all non­strict views, such a person will be on the verge of heterodoxy.

Furthermore, Ahmad said: Sulayman Al­Taymy said, \"If you acted on the non­strict view or mistake of every scholar, you will combine all aspects of evil.\" He also gave the fatwa that musical instruments such as tambourine or the like should be broken once seen exposed when it is feasible to break them. There are also two conflicting narrations from him regarding whether musical instruments should be broken if seen hidden under clothes. Regarding the issue of some orphans who inherited a songstress slave­girl and wish to sell her, he viewed that she should be sold as naive. He was argued that the slave­girl equals 20000 or more if sold as a songstress and 2000 or less if sold as naive. However, he insisted that she should be sold only as naive. Had the revenue of singing been lawful, he would not have let orphans lose such a large sum of money. As for listening to the singing of a non­Mahram (spouse or unmarriageable relative) or of a beardless person, it is one of the greatest sins and most likely to corrupt one's faith.",

We ask Allah to guide us and all Muslims to that which pleases Him and to be safe from all reasons leading to His wrath and punishment. We seek Allah's refuge from the evils of ourselves and our bad deeds. My advice to Abu Turab and all those fond of songs and musical instruments to fear Allah, repent to Him and to return to truth, for, indeed, returning to truth is a virtue and persistence in error is vice. Had not we aimed at briefing, we would have drawn attention to all mistakes made by Abu Turab in his article. However, farsighted persons can easily find such mistakes through the abovementioned facts. We seek Allah's help and rely on Him. There is no might or power except with Allah. Allah is sufficient for us and the Best of those on whom to depend. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.",

Many scholars explain Allah's saying: And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mean singing. `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) used to swear that the idle talk here refers to singing. Yet, it is even more detestable if singing is accompanied with a musical instrument, such as rababah i.e. Arab fiddle, lute, violin, and drums. Some scholars state that singing accompanied with musical instruments is unanimously forbidden. Hence, it is obligatory to beware of that.",

Furthermore, loud speakers are not permitted in weddings and so are the prohibited songs usually played, because they entail great Fitnah (temptation) and bad consequences as well as harming Muslims.
