It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) when asked about the children of the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) said: Allah knows what sort of deeds they would have done. Some religious scholars viewed that the Knowledge of Allah (Glorified be He) about them is manifested on the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be tested in the way of Ahl­ul­Fatrah (those to whom Da`wah has not reached in an uncorrupted manner). Thus, if they obediently submit to what they are asked, they will enter Paradise; but if they disobey, they will enter the Fire. Hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) about testing Ahl­ul­Fatrah on the Day of Resurrection were proven authentic. This also applies to those who receive the same religious ruling, such as the children of the disbelievers.",
