Accordingly, they began thinking of a more devilish alternative which is more effective than crushing military wars. After many conventions and studies of the conditions of Muslims, they decided that Christian nations, individuals and groups, should collaborate in conquering the Muslim youth culturally, for they considered that rendering the Islamic world culturally and mentally subordinate to the Christian world, is more likely to achieve their objectives than merely occupying the land.",
