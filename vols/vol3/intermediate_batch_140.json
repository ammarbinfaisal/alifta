Then he washes the rest of the body, beginning with the right side then the left side. He repeats this procedure two or three times, each time gently pressing the deceased's stomach. If anything happens to come out of one of the two orifices, then he has to wash it off and then block off the affected orifice with a piece of cotton wool or something similar to it. If this fails to work, he can then use anything that can satisfactorily serve the purpose, such as the use of adhesive plaster that is used in modern medical treatment.",

Al­ `Umary recited some Adhkar (invocations) on the Jinn­possessed lady and talked to the Jinn, reminding him of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Omnipotence as well as frightening him with the grievous sin of injustice. After the Jinn said that he is a Buddhist disbeliever, the shaykh called him to Islam and to come out of the woman whom he was possessing. Accordingly, the Jinn complied and declared his conversion to Islam before shaykh Al­`Umary. Then, shaykh Al­ `Umary and the guardians of the woman wanted to come to me with the woman to hear the Jinn member's conversion to Islam. When they were all present, I asked the Jinn about the reason for embracing Islam. He spoke on the tongue of the woman but in a manly voice. All this happened in the presence of the woman who was sitting in the chair next to me beside her brother, sister and shaykh Al­`Umary as well as some shayks who witnessed and heard the speech of the Jinn while openly declaring his conversion to Islam. He said he was a Buddhist from India. On my part, I advised him to observe Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared) and to leave the body of this woman as he is making her suffer. The Jinn submitted to my order and said that he embraced Islam willingly. Therefore, I advised him",
