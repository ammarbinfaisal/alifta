The point is that he first asked about the requirements of Iman because it purifies the Muslim inwardly in a way that is reflected upon his outward behavior. This is why Allah defined Islam as outward submission because it has to do with a Muslim's submissiveness to Allah (may He be Praised). The word \"Islam\" indicates submission to Allah (Exalted be He), and obeying His Commands.

When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about Iman, he said, To have faith in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and the Divine destiny whether good or bad. He explained Iman as believing in these six matters which are essentially the fundamentals of Faith and the Deen of Islam, for whoever lacks Iman has no share in Islam, and whoever lacks Islam is not a Mu'min (believer). Accordingly, believing in these essential requirements of Iman is a prerequisite for the validity of one's Islam.

He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should keep good relation with his Kith and kin. He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should not hurt his neighbors. To explain it further, Iman entails practicing good deeds. Thus, Islam without Iman is the act of hypocrites. The perfect Iman necessitates abiding by what Allah and His Messenger commanded and refraining from what they forbade. If a Muslim falls short in adhering to this, then he is not a believer as Allah negated Iman from the Bedouins in His statement: Say: \"You believe not but you only say, 'We have surrendered (in Islâm)\" and as negated also by the previous Hadiths.",

Similarly, he is predestined as far as Allah's Knowledge is concerned and led to doing good or bad according to Allah's Predestined Will, and as such, he cannot do anything contrary to what Allah decreed for him.

Likewise, during the times of Hud, Salih, Ibrahim (Abraham), and the prophets who came after them until and including Musa and ' Isa (peace be upon them all), the Din was Tawhid, being sincere to Him, believing in the Messenger whom Allah had commissioned, and following the Message he came with. When Allah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Islam that Allah accepts became the one He divinely revealed to His Prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), which is belief in Allah, profession of Tawhid, sincerity in 'Ibadah to Him, belief in His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) and what was revealed to him, i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and belief in those prophets and Messengers who were commissioned before him. Whoever follows him and believes in what he came with is a Muslim, and whoever deviates from that after they have heard the Da'wah (Call to Islam) is a Kafir. It is the duty of Muslims to invite people to Al­Haqq (the Truth), explain Islam and its merits, show its reality to all people in the languages they understand, in order to convey the Message of Allah and His Prophet.

Christianity is no longer a right Din for us or anyone; the true Din that should be embraced by Muslims and all people is the Islam with which Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muslims are enjoined to invite others to their religion, defend it, and show the falsity of all religions, including Judaism and Christianity, except Islam.

Imitation is only tolerated in case of necessity when the person followed is known for their knowledge, virtue, and upright creed, as explained in detail by the eminent scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim (may Allah be merciful with him) in his book I`lam Al­Mawaqqi`in. The Imams (may Allah be merciful with them) would deny that any of their views be adopted other than that which was in accordance with the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Imam Malik (may Allah be merciful with him) said: The view of every one is liable to acceptance and refusal except for that of the one [entombed] in this grave (referring to the grave of the Prophet, peace be upon him). His fellow Imams also uttered sayings to the same effect. Thus, a person who manages to adopt the Qur'an and the Sunnah must not imitate anyone. Yet, in case of controversy, he should assume the saying nearest to the truth.

Rather, it constitutes disapproval of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), since He mentioned some of them in His Honorable Book and revealed some others to His Prophet (peace be upon him). Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) never spoke of his own desire, but rather conveyed what Allah (Exalted be He) revealed to him. Thus, Al­Sabuny (may Allah guide him) sometimes says that he adheres to the Madh­hab of Ahl­ul­Sunnah and sometimes disagrees with and rejects it. Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. We ask Allah to guide us and him and to help us return to the right. As for his saying, \"They say in affirmation of these Attributes that Allah sits in the way a person sits on a bed and descends in the way a person descends the stair ...\", Ahl­ul­Sunnah undoubtedly disavow such claims.

Furthermore, what he mentioned about the Salaf as regards their interpretation of Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, And He is with you (by His Knowledge) that it means \"by His Knowledge\", is not an allegorical interpretation. Rather, it is the meaning of the verses \"on being in the company of Allah\" in the sight of Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama'ah as related by Imam Abu `Umar ibn `Abdul­Barr and Abu `Umar Al­Telamnaky that Ahl­ul­Sunnah unanimously agree to this view because it is affirmed by the related texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, which indicate Allah's Highness, Sublimity, and being far above immanentism. Thus, whoever contemplates the verses related to the present issue would perceive that the meaning of (Allah's) company is His encompassment of His Slaves' affairs and circumstances, while 'the special company' refers to His preservation, protection, safeguarding, and support of His prophets and Awliya', as well as His encompassment of their circumstances. Undoubtedly, the Arabs ­ upon whom the Book was sent down and in whose language the Sunnah was expressed ­ are acquainted with this meaning. As it was not ambiguous to them, they did not ask the Prophet (peace be upon him) about the meaning of such verses. Rather, it was crystal clear for them. However, the other texts need no allegorical interpretation since their meanings are clear, such as Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, Floating under Our Eyes , in order that you may be brought up under My Eye. and, So wait patiently (O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) for the Decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes For, none could ever imagine that the ship floats with Allah's Eye or that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is in Allah's Eye. Rather, it means that the ship floats through Allah's protection, preservation, safeguarding of and subjecting it, and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is sheltered by His Lord's preservation, protection, and guardianship. This also applies to Allah's saying about Musa (Moses) in order that you may be brought up under My Eye. i.e. under My Preservation and Protection.

Then, we say to Al­Sabuny, \"The scholars of Al­Asha`irah are not among the followers of Abu Al­Hasan Al­Ash`ary, since he recanted Ta'wil on the Attributes and assumed the Madh­hab of Ahl­ul­Sunnah Wal­Jama`ah as regards affirmation of (Divine) Names and Attributes and acknowledgement of them just as they are mentioned without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (denial of Allah's Attributes), Takyif (questioning Allah's Attributes), or Tamthil (likening Allah's Attributes to those of His Creation). He explained that in his two books, Al­Ibanah and Al­Maqamat. Therefore, it becomes clear that whoever performs Ta'wil on the Attributes from among those affiliated with Al­Ash`ary is not really a follower of his new Madh­hab. Rather, he would be a follower of his old Madh­hab, knowing that the Madh­hab of the scholar is the last to which he adhered and believed in before his death, not that which he claimed earlier and then recanted. Hence, we should be aware of this and be cautious against those who confuse matters and put things in other than their due positions. After all, we ask for the help of Allah Alone.",

As for, Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. forgetting here does not really mean that mentioned in Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, and your Lord is never forgetful or in His (Exalted be He) saying, in a Record.

Forgetting is affirmed in Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. means He (Exalted be He) left them in their aberration and abandoned them because they neglected His Commands and turned away from His religion due to their hypocrisy and denial. The kind of forgetting that is disaffirmed for Allah (Exalted be He) is that which denotes amnesia and oblivion; for Allah (Exalted be He) is far above such forgetting due to His Perfect Omniscience and Encompassing Knowledge of all the affairs and conditions of His slaves. Indeed, He is the Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists; no slumber or sleep overtakes Him. May He be Glorified and Exalted above all this. Thus, it becomes clear that explaining forgetting to mean abandonment in Allah's (Exalted be He) saying, The hypocrites, men and women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Munkar (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islâm has forbidden), and forbid (people) from Al­M a' rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allâh's Cause) alms.]. They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. does not involve Ta'wil.

The Shaykh interpreted the Saying of Allah (whose meanings translated as): The Hand of Allâh is over their hands. He said that this Ayah has more than one meaning. It can be Allah's Help given to them, Allah's Power with them, or Allah's Knowledge of their conditions and intentions. After the seminar finished, one brother told the Shaykh that his interpretation of this Ayah goes against `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and complies with the views of Asha`irah (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic). The Shaykh was annoyed and replied that Al­Mawardy and Ibn Kathir mentioned this interpretation in their books. The man corrected him saying that Ibn Kathir did not state that, but it is Al­Mawardy who advocated Asha`irah. The debate heated and people behaved aggressively labeling the man a Christian and Buddhist and they were about to beat him but some protected him. Allah knows that this man wanted to explain the truth out of his jealousy for the Muslim `Aqidah and the impermissibility to delay the declaration beyond the time of need.

Discussing the Attributes comes under the heading of discussing the Divine Self. Whatever is said about the Divine Self, the same can in all respects be said about the Divine Attributes.

We say that Allah (Exalted be He) has a Hand and Eyes, but we do not say that His Hand implies Power and His Hearing implies having knowledge. Then he (may Allah be merciful to him) quoted as evidence affirming Allah's Attribute of having a Hand the following Ayah: The Jews say: \"Allâh's Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).\" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills. Allah (Exalted be He) also has said to Iblis (Satan): What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands. He (Glorified be He) also says: They made not a just estimate of Allâh such as is due to Him.

Do they not heartily believe that they are Muslims and carry birth certificates and identity cards that say they are Muslims?! (Surely, the answer is yes) even, the constitutions of almost all their countries state that their religion is Islam. Why then do they talk much about Islam? What is the objective of these journals or these pages? Do they call for Prayers? The mosques are full with praying persons who know well how to straighten the lines and who reply to the Imam 'our lines are straightened'. Is it a call, for example, for Hajj? Indeed, most of the Muslims hasten to perform Hajj and Allah is more aware of intentions. Is it a call for Zakah? Indeed, many of them pay Zakah, voluntarily or involuntarily. Verily, Islam about which people talk much implies all these pillars.

At first, six of them met the Prophet (peace be upon him) near Al­Jamrah; they accepted the Prophet's call and pledged to convey the Prophet's message to their people in Madinah. Hence, many of their people embraced Islam. The following year, twelve people of Al­Ansar, including the six who had met with him previously, came to the Prophet (peace be upon him). As`ad Ibn Zurarh (may Allah be pleased with him) and some of his tribe, Al­Khazraj, and two people (or three, according to some narrations) from Al­Aws met the Prophet (peace be upon him) on one of the days of Al­Tashriq (11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul Hijjah). He (peace be upon him) recited the Ever­Glorious Qur'an to them and they pledged allegiance to him (peace be upon him) and embraced Islam. They returned to their people and called them to Allah; hence, Islam spread among Al­Ansar, who all entered Islam except a few.

Anyway, this is a Shadh single narration, and it is not permissible for the one who believes in Allah and in the Day of Resurrection to hold by it and contradict the Hadith Sahih that clearly indicate the prohibition of swearing by other than Allah and that it is a forbidden act that is tantamount to Shirk.",

These trails include lower desires, doubts and war. Most dangerous of all is succumbing to one's lower desires, which weak souls are most inclined to. A believer may be tricked and gradually sink into immoral acts leading to the loss of faith. The way to salvation and safety is to distance oneself from the ways that lead to such temptations, to be on guard as much as possible, and to diligently ask Allah for steadfastness in faith. One must also recite the Qur'an and meditate on its Ayahs which guide us to Allah and contain rational evidence and theoretical proofs of the existence and oneness of Allah, His sovereignty, His worth of being glorified, His Shari`ah worth of being followed, and His limits that should not be transgressed. Once Iman is deep­rooted hearts can taste its beauty, become enlightened by evidence, and it becomes difficult to be uprooted or replaced with any alternative.

They only call for Islamic Alliance on the claim of guarding Muslims against the danger of the extrinsic ideas, while, for sure, they intend Socialism.

Nevertheless, they attributed them to themselves and denied ascribing the right to the legal owners out of ignorance or grudge. When the Saudi government combats Socialism or other destructive ideologies, it does not do so because they are imported but because they are atheist systems that disagree with the Shari`ah, reject the Divine Codes, oppose Allah (Glorified be He), and deny His Existence. Aside from this, it prohibits what He has enjoined as lawful and permits what He has prescribed as forbidden.

And if they say so, pray like our prayers, slaughter as we slaughter, and face our Qiblah (Ka`bah­direction faced in Prayer), then they have our rights and are bound to our duties. From the proofs of the Sunnah is whatis reported by Muslim in the Sahih from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, so if they say it, then they save their lives and property from me except legally, and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah. From these Hadiths is whatis also reported by Muslim in the Sahih from Tariq ibn Ashyam Al­ Ashja`y (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever says none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and in another narration, He who professed that there is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah and made a denial of everything which the people worship besides Allah, his property and blood become inviolable, and their affairs rest with Allah. There are many other Hadiths supporting this meaning and all of them prove that fighting in Islam is meant to end disbelief and call the disbelievers to enter into the religion of Allah not because they attack us only, and therefore, he (peace be upon him) said: When they do that, then they save their lives and property from me except legally. He did not say: \"And if they restrain from fighting us or stay away from us,\" but he said: ...until they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, perform Salah, and pay Zakah. If they do that... This is a proof that what is required from them is to revert to Islam; otherwise, the sword will be the choice, except the people of Jizyah as stated before. It is noted that he (peace be upon him) confined the matter to the two testimonies of faith (testifying that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah), performing Salah, and paying Zakah (obligatory charity) because they are the great foundations and the main pillars of Islam. Thus, whoever follows, believes, and abides by them, then he will be more deserving of performing other duties with true faith and assurance. This is what I wanted to, briefly, attract the attention to, and I hope that it will fulfill the purpose of pointing out the truth and defeating falsehood.

          "text": "Indeed, there and many well­known Qur'anic verses that command and urge believers to have taqwa and demonstrate the promised rewards for that both in the worldly life and in the Hereafter. Taqwa is a general word that encompasses all kinds of goodness; it is obeying and fulfilling the commands of Allah (Exalted be He) and eschewing all His prohibitions, and advising one another and co­operating with one another in doing so. He who does so seeking the good Pleasure of Almighty Allah and fearing His Punishment has truly attained proper taqwa and great success. My brothers and sisters. We have to adhere to this path of taqwa to the best of our abilities. You have already known the bad consequences of lacking taqwa such as the cruelty of hearts and deep heedlessness of the commands ordained by Allah on His Servants, and the delay of rain and the aridity that afflicted many countries. There is no remedy for this except by turning back to Almighty Allah, having fear of Him and repenting to Him of past sins; and advising one another to do so. Once this is done by people with humble hearts and truthful tongues, and with fear and hope, Allah will give them whatever they like and keep away from them whatever they dislike, and He will rectify their hearts and guide their deeds, as promised in the verses quoted above and in the known Hadith.",

Another Hadith says, What separates us (believers) from them (non­believers) is the Prayer; whosoever abandons it has become a disbeliever. Our religion tells us that no one observes Prayer but a believer and that no one abandons it but a hypocrite. Allah (Exalted be He) dispraised the hypocrites and promised them the lowest rank of Hell; as He (May He be Exalted) says, Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As­Salât (the prayer), they stand with laziness Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) threatened that he would burn the houses of those who would fail to attend the congregational Prayer in the mosque.It is narrated in \"Al­Musnad\"from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said, \"If it were not for the women and children in the houses, I would burn their houses upon them (i.e. men who do not attend congregational Prayers in the mosque).\" It is narrated in Sahih Muslim that, A blind man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque. So, could you give me permission to offer Prayer in my house? In response, he (the Prophet) asked: Do you hear the call to Prayer? The man said: Yes! Upon this, the Prophet said: Respond to it. (in another version, he said: I cannot give you permission.) And another Hadith says, He who hears the call (Adhaan) and does not respond to it will not be deemed to have offered the Prayer unless he has a valid excuse (for that). So, fear Allah, O Servants of Allah, and honor the Prayer and perform it properly and regularly in the mosque. Advise one another to do so and denounce any failure in this regard, so that all of you may be saved from the Wrath and Punishment of Almighty Allah and win His Mercy and Honor both in this worldly life and in the Hereafter.",

So, praise be to Allah, how heinous is such a claim and how far distanced from guidance is it! According to well­ established religious matters that are recorded in authentic references, the Muslims unanimously agree that whoever belies Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him), even if about a small matter, deems apostasy from Islam permissible, or says that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent to the Arabs only or to the people living during his lifetime, becomes a Kafir and Murtad, whose killing is declared lawful and whose money is to be seized. Praise be to Allah, this point is uncontroversial among religious scholars, and, thus, there is no need for more elaboration on the matter through quoting such unanimity from reliable sources. I hope that what is already mentioned is satisfactory for the questioner and for the readers in general. Undoubtedly, the Kufr of Ghulam Ahmad Birwiz, according to what is quoted of his beliefs and opinions, is taken for granted by common Muslims, not to mention scholars. Thus, there is no more need to state in great detail the proofs of such a claim. We ask Allah to safeguard the Muslims from the evil of Ghulam Ahmad and those like him, to bridle the enemies of Islam wherever they may be, to foil their intrigues, and to let them perish in their rage without fulfilling their intentions; verily, He is Able to do all things.",

Accordingly, the Jinn complied and declared his conversion to Islam before shaykh Al­`Umary. Then, shaykh Al­ `Umary and the guardians of the woman wanted to come to me with the woman to hear the Jinn member's conversion to Islam. When they were all present, I asked the Jinn about the reason for embracing Islam. He spoke on the tongue of the woman but in a manly voice.

It also becomes clear that such are all satanic acts and jugglery included under acts warned against by the Prophet (peace be upon him) such as asking diviners, soothsayers, augurs and the like. It is thus obligatory on officials in Muslim states to ban and eliminate such falsehood prescribing deterrent penalties against those indulgent in them. It is also obligatory on editors­in­chief of Muslim newspapers not to publish such falsehood which might defame their newspapers. Rather, they have to criticize and refute it and warn people against the traps, deceptions and illusions of both human and jinn devils. Indeed, Allah says the truth and guides to the straight path. We ask Him to reform the states of Muslims, grant them clear understanding of the religion, and protect them against the deception of criminals and the illusions of devils patrons, for, in fact, He is the One capable to do so. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad.",

There are however many proofs which maintain that the successor after the Prophet (peace be upon him) was to be Abu Bakr Al­Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him). This was also maintained by all other Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, he (peace be upon him) did not explicitly recommend this or issue a conclusive recommendation on it. Yet, he gave orders that indicate it, such as when he ordered Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer at the time he (peace be upon him) was sick. Besides, when the matter of succession was mentioned to him, he (peace be upon him) said: Allah and the Mu'minun (believers) deny anyone (be successor) except Abu Bakr And for this reason, the Companions pledged allegiance to him (may Allah be pleased with him) after the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), including `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him). They unanimously agreed that Abu Bakr was the best of them. It was authentically reported in the Hadith narrated by Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to say during the life of the Prophet (peace be upon him): The best of people in this Ummah (nation) after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then `Umar, then `Uthman And the Prophet (peace be upon him) agreed to this. There are successive narrations from `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) that he used to say: The best of people in this Ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then `Umar. He (may Allah be pleased with him) would also say, \"No one would give me preference over them except that I would whip him\", and he never referred to himself as the best of the Ummah or that the Messenger (peace be upon him) recommended him for succession. In addition, he never claimed that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) wronged him or usurp his rights. On the other hand, upon the death of Fatimah",

Then, when `Umar, being stabbed, left the issue of nomination of a successor to be decided through Shura (consultation) among six of the ten heaven­bound Companions, including `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him). The latter, however, did not disapprove of what was done by `Umar, neither during his life nor after his death. Furthermore, he never said that he was more worthy of it than them all. How then can anyone fabricate lies against the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and say that \"he recommended that `Aly be a successor to him. Even `Aly himself did not claim that for himself, nor did any of the Companions. Rather, they all agreed to the validity of having as successors Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman. And this was acknowledged by `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him), who cooperated with them all in Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) and Shura and other affairs. Then, the Muslims following the generation of the Companions unanimously agreed to what the Companions had acknowledged. It is therefore not permissible for any human or any sect, including the Shi`ah or anyone else to claim that `Aly was to be the successor or that succession before him was null and void. Likewise, it is not permissible for anyone to say that the Companions wronged `Aly and usurped his rights.

Allah's Sacred Shari'ah (Law) forbids all mans leading to unlawful actions and makes them Haram (prohibited) in themselves. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) commanded the wives of the Prophet and all believing women to remain in their homes and to wear their Hijab (veil) if they must go out for some need.

Undoubtedly, this is one of the tricks of Satan by which he tries to deceive the people who lack knowledge and religion, so that they prefer listening to the \"Qu'ran\" of Satan – namely songs – to listening to the Qur'an of Allah and the Hadith of His Messenger (peace be upon him). The Salaf rebuked severely those who occupied themselves with singing and musical instrument, described them with insolence and Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law), and did not accept their testimony as will be explained later, In sha'a­Allah. This is because preoccupation with singing and musical instruments leads to weakness of Iman (Faith/belief) and lack of shyness and piety. Even more, it results in belittling the Commands and Prohibitions of Allah. Moreover, the people preoccupied with singing and musical instruments become in a state of heedlessness, recline to falsehood, become sluggish to perform Salah (Prayer) and acts of charity, but active in doing evils which signing drives to, such as Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), sodomy, drinking Khamr (intoxicant) and having sex with women, except those whom Allah saved.",

This gives evidence to the fact that this kind of singing is to be tolerable on the part of young girls on the days of `Eid, for they are days of happiness and joy and because the two girls chanted the song of the Ansar which they sang on the Day of Bu`ath. The song was related to courage and war, unlike the present songs which male and female singers sing. The singing of today arouses sexual desires and calls to adoration of pictures and to Fitnah (temptation), which diverts hearts from glorifying Allah and respecting His Right. So how could a reasonable person makes Qiyas (analogy) between them?

According to both meanings, the noble Ayah includes a dispraise of those people who will end up as Satan's followers in tempting believers from their faith and mocking Allah's Ayahs as well as abandoning His book. Reality attests to this as many of those who follow their whims and are preoccupied by singing and musical instruments ended with their hearts as deprived of Iman and diverted from Al­Haqq (the Truth) except those to whom Allah showed His Mercy. Furthermore, the Islamic Shari`ah with its perfect resources from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him) indicate the obligation of averting all means leading to deviance and malice so as to avoid falling victim to bad outcomes that inevitably come with such sins. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade drinking little amounts of any intoxicant lest this should tempt one to drink more, as he (peace be upon him) stated, If a large amount of anything causes intoxication, a small amount of it is prohibited. By the same token, the Prophet forbade offering Salah after Fajr (Dawn) or `Asr (Afternoon) Prayers lest Muslims should fall into the sin of imitating Mushriks (those associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) who worship the sun when it rises and sets.

Hence, you should know, dear reader, that these three reasons refute the claim of Abu Turab and render it invalid. Furthermore, it becomes equally clear that the noble Ayah is an apparent proof on dispraising singing and music, and prohibiting them as a means of deviance and mocking Allah's words even if those who indulge in this vice are unaware of its seriousness. This is the meaning that the Salaf derived from the Ayah. Evidently, they are the most knowledgeable people in the meanings of the legal texts and their application and the most worthy of being followed (may Allah be pleased with them). We also refuted the claim of Abu Turab concerning the Hadith of the two slave girls and the Hadith of Abu Mas`ud Al­Badri and his companions who have been permitted to sing in a wedding.

Moreover, scholars accepted his behaving as such and deemed as Sahih the Hadiths recorded by him in the form of Mu`allaq Hadiths for which he used wording of certainty.

He criticizes that Al­Bukhari related it saying: Hisham ibn `Ammar said... mentioning the latter's chain of narrators. Ibn Hazm claims that there is a missing link between Al­Bukhari and Hisham.

In fact, the Hadith is Sahih and is related through other uninterrupted chains of narrators meeting the conditions necessary for a Sahih Hadith. Furthermore, Al­ Bukhari may do so because he related the Hadith in another place in his Book through an uninterrupted chain of narrators.

Furthermore, Ahmad said: Sulayman Al­Taymy said, \"If you acted on the non­strict view or mistake of every scholar, you will combine all aspects of evil.\" He also gave the fatwa that musical instruments such as tambourine or the like should be broken once seen exposed when it is feasible to break them. There are also two conflicting narrations from him regarding whether musical instruments should be broken if seen hidden under clothes. Regarding the issue of some orphans who inherited a songstress slave­girl and wish to sell her, he viewed that she should be sold as naive. He was argued that the slave­girl equals 20000 or more if sold as a songstress and 2000 or less if sold as naive. However, he insisted that she should be sold only as naive. Had the revenue of singing been lawful, he would not have let orphans lose such a large sum of money. As for listening to the singing of a non­Mahram (spouse or unmarriageable relative) or of a beardless person, it is one of the greatest sins and most likely to corrupt one's faith.",

What could be more devastating and a reflection of weak minds and demoralization than an Islamic country that seeks to propagate a despicable call and one of the ugliest abominations and immoral manners for which it should take as an example a nation that publicly expresses its sternest enmity towards Islam and Arabs, and which was cursed by Allah (Exalted be He). Accordingly, those who follow it will have a share of Allah's Wrath. Allah (Exalted be He) distinguished between His Creatures and ranked them differently with regard to their aspirations and objectives. Those who want to make reform should call for high morals, honorable deeds, and seeking to develop beneficial businesses and factories that will do good for the nation in this age of material advancement, and diversified ideologies. On the other hand, there are those whose morals are heavily degraded to the extent that they call to the most degradable manners and immorality. They call for what undermines the stability of their nations and pushes them away from the road to prosperity and reformation which are only attained by means of painstaking efforts. Furthermore, they do not urge their nations to imitate other nations in the fields of advancement that could be applied in their own countries but their aim is to drive it in the way of evil, not goodness and in the way of what causes harm, not benefit.
