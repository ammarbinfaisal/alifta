Likewise, during the times of Hud, Salih, Ibrahim (Abraham), and the prophets who came after them until and including Musa and ' Isa (peace be upon them all), the Din was Tawhid, being sincere to Him, believing in the Messenger whom Allah had commissioned, and following the Message he came with. When Allah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Islam that Allah accepts became the one He divinely revealed to His Prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), which is belief in Allah, profession of Tawhid, sincerity in 'Ibadah to Him, belief in His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) and what was revealed to him, i.e. the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and belief in those prophets and Messengers who were commissioned before him. Whoever follows him and believes in what he came with is a Muslim, and whoever deviates from that after they have heard the Da'wah (Call to Islam) is a Kafir. It is the duty of Muslims to invite people to Al­Haqq (the Truth), explain Islam and its merits, show its reality to all people in the languages they understand, in order to convey the Message of Allah and His Prophet. They must also expose and refute the suspicions that are raised by the enemies of Islam against Islam, and explain their falseness using textual and rational evidence.",

Accordingly, it is known that criticizing the Christianity that has been attributed to a so­called son of Allah, clarifying its falsehood and it being a Din that has been changed and distorted by the people, and later abrogated by sending Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his Shari' ah is obligatory on Muslims. Christianity is no longer a right Din for us or anyone; the true Din that should be embraced by Muslims and all people is the Islam with which Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muslims are enjoined to invite others to their religion, defend it, and show the falsity of all religions, including Judaism and Christianity, except Islam. By doing so, they are inviting people to Al­Haqq and Jannah (Paradise), while others are inviting people to the Fire.

This is because the proper action is to follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah and not to imitate anyone people. Imitation is only tolerated in case of necessity when the person followed is known for their knowledge, virtue, and upright creed, as explained in detail by the eminent scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim (may Allah be merciful with him) in his book I`lam Al­Mawaqqi`in. The Imams (may Allah be merciful with them) would deny that any of their views be adopted other than that which was in accordance with the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Imam Malik (may Allah be merciful with him) said: The view of every one is liable to acceptance and refusal except for that of the one [entombed] in this grave (referring to the grave of the Prophet, peace be upon him). His fellow Imams also uttered sayings to the same effect. Thus, a person who manages to adopt the Qur'an and the Sunnah must not imitate anyone. Yet, in case of controversy, he should assume the saying nearest to the truth. However, a person who can not do so is entitled to ask [religious] scholars, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,",
