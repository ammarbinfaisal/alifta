Anyone who has an idea about Muslim history will be certain that what we have mentioned is true and can never be ignored; the only reason for that was the sincerity of the early generations in their belief in Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger and their defense of the Cause of Allah by word, action, and belief. Dear Muslim brothers, here are some Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) confirming this concept to be fully aware and well­informed. You can call to the Path of your Lord and draw the attention of your Muslim brothers to the factors that bring about victory and (warn them against) the causes of defeat. It is authentically narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"Verily, if Allah were to guide just one man through you, it would be better for you than red camels.\" Allah (Glorified be He) says, O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur'an) unanimously decided that supporting Allah (Glorified be He) means, supporting His religion by acting upon its teachings, calling to it and fighting those who oppose it.

We respect all divinely inspired faiths.\" Since this declaration about the Jews and Judaism is contrary to the Evident Text of the Noble Book (Qur'an) and the Purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). It also disagrees with the Islamic `Aqidah (creed). It is a declaration that can create confusion among some people. I thought it is necessary to warn people against the false statement included in it out of obedience to Allah and sincerity to His Servants. I say that it is evident in the Book, Sunnah, and all Muslim Scholars that Muslims should disapprove the disbelief of the unbelievers such as the Jews, the Christians, and all other Mushriks.

I have chosen this subject for its great significance. It is well­known that studying the Islamic Shari`ah and relevant issues concerning its merits, benefits, and protection of servants, and every text concerning our need is indeed a great matter. In addition, our need for it is great. Understanding and paying attention to that issue is one of the most important matters. Being motivated by the importance of this subject, its significance, and our pressing need to understand it better and have more insight into it, I thought it should be the subject of my lecture.

Whoever contemplates the Shari`ah with its resources and sources and considers its great and just rulings, its benevolence to all creatures and its care for the poor, the needy, the young, the old and others; and even animals, Shari`ah takes care of them and prohibits oppression and transgression against them, he will come to know that it is a law descended from Allah, the All­Wise, the Worthy of all praise, the All­Knowing of the circumstances of His Servants and the Well­Acquainted with what is best for them. He will also know that the Shari`ah is one of the decisive evidence for the existence of Allah (Exalted be He), His Perfect Power, Wisdom and Knowledge and the truthfulness of His Messenger (peace be upon him), for he is the Messenger of Allah. So when you ponder on the rulings of this Shari`ah and its great concern for the servants' affairs whether rich or poor, owners or workers, ruling or ruled, and individuals or groups, you can see that it pays much attention to all of them and enacted rulings based on benefit, justice, equity, benevolence, and mercy. Indeed, it is a Shari`ah full of benefits, morals, guidance and justice. If any matter deviated from justice to injustice, from benefit to harm and from mercy to its opposite, it does not belong to the Shari`ah even if it is falsely attributed to it by Ta'wil (allegorical interpretation) as stressed in meaning by the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim (may Allah be Merciful with him). Our Shari`ah is full of mercy, justice, and wisdom. It cares mostly for the Muslims' interests and is far removed from abuse, oppression, and hardship. Whoever ponders on that which was previously mentioned, will know what I meant in the second part of the title of this lecture which explains that humans are in great need of the Shari`ah because of its great benefits. It pays much concern to the Muslims' interests during their life and after their death and paves the way which leads to survival and happiness.

So, whoever holds fast to this great Shari`ah and persists in acting according to it will survive, but whoever deviates from it will perish. Indeed, there is neither might nor power except with Allah. It is clear for any rational Muslim that all the servants of Allah are in dire need of the Shari`ah for it introduces the solutions for their problems and includes just rulings and takes a moderate stance between corrupt Marxist, atheistic, Communism, and unfair, oppressive Capitalism. It is moderate in every thing as it has a moderate economy between the communism and materialism of the atheists and the oppressive capitalism which has no limits. So Shari`ah is intermediate between two extremes, just between these two unjust matters and moderate in all aspects; there is no extremity or exceeding of the proper limits and no extremity in aversion. This great Shari`ah is moderate in spending and abstention without extravagance or wastefulness and without abstention or niggardliness. Allah (Exalted be He) says, And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. Allah (Glorified be He) says concerning the attributes of the Servants of the Most Beneficent (Allah), And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). So whoever ponders on this matter and pays attention to it will know that the Shari`ah is both a religion and a state, a book and sword, an act of `Ibadah (worship) and good treatment (of others), Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) and good deeds, spending money (in the way of Allah) and Ihsan (the perfection of Faith), obedience to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), repentance from past (sins) and performing good deeds for the future.

We seek refuge with Allah from all these allegations, as all servants are obliged to submit to the rulings of Shari`ah and its laws, in acts of worship and other aspects of life.
