In the course of the blessed Da`wah (calling to Islam), the youth played a prominent role, as well as the leading role of the elders who provided guidance and support to the Ummah of Islam, the Ummah of the everlasting message which occupies the first place among other Ummahs when Allah (Exalted be He) honored it with this religion and the leader of messengers ­ Muhammad (peace be upon him). All, under the leadership of Muhammad ibn `Abdullah (peace be upon him), continued to establish the early Islamic state which expanded to new horizons. The banner of Islam fluttered high over most parts of the earth during the different ages of Islam, when leading youth would defend Islam and Muslim homes by their powers and tongues, and through their knowledge and deeds. At the same time, they would lead the ranks for Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) to make the Word of Allah most supreme, they would also gather in crowds in Halaqahs (learning circles) at the hands of great shaykhs, seeking their wisdom and getting enlightened with their knowledge, taking advice, and guidance from them and availing themselves of the fruit of their efforts and experience accompanied by the practice of the Shari`ah of Islam.",
