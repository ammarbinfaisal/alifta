Finally, Allah made His religion victorious, supported His call and helped the Prophet (peace be upon him) against his enemies until he was satisfied before his death when he saw the religion was victorious. Thus, Al­Haqq (the Truth) has become established, Tawhid has spread on earth, and idols were eliminated after he conquered Makkah in Ramadan, 8th A.H. People entered into the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) in crowds as a result of this conquest. Eventually, Quraysh accepted Islam and then the Arab tribes accepted Tawhid, sincerity and Shari`ah to which the Prophet (peace be upon him) called them. In conclusion, the Prophet (peace be upon him) called to the same teachings as the previous messengers since prophet Nuh and those who followed him. This call was mainly about Tawhid, sincerity, and avoiding the worship of anything else but Allah (Exalted be He). This is his first Da`wah (calling to Islam), its core, and the most important and great obligation. The children of Adam were on pure Tawhid since Adam to Nuh for ten centuries as Ibn `Abbas and his students said. However, when they disagreed over polytheism that had spread among the people of Nuh, Allah (Exalted be He) sent messengers. Allah (Exalted be He) says:",

When polytheism spread among the people of Nuh because of their over­estimation of the pious and because Satan allured them to worship those pious people instead of Allah (Exalted be He), He sent them Nuh (peace be upon him) to call them to Tawhid, sincerity and avoiding worship of other than Allah. So, Nuh (peace be upon him) was the first messenger sent by Allah (Exalted be He) to the people on earth after the spread of polytheism. As for Adam, weak narrations mention his prophethood but they are weak and undependable because of their weak chain of narration. There is no doubt that a Shari`ah was revealed to him from his Lord.

Allah (Exalted be He) informed us about the stories of some of them and did not inform us about the stories of the others, because of His great wisdom. The most important thing is to know that they all called for Tawhid and devotion of worship for Him (may He be Praised and Glorified). They also called their nations to devotion and some of them accepted the call while others refused. Some of the prophets were followed by only a few while others could not find anyone to follow, as is reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the seal and the best of the prophets. His whole account with his people who fought and acted hostilely against him in Makkah Al­Mukarramah is well known. He and his Sahabah underwent a great deal of harm to the extent that people conspired to kill him but Allah (Exalted be He) rescued him. In Al­Madinah, great battles and Jihad took place until Allah (Exalted be He) supported him and made him victorious. Thus, it is clear for all that the essence of the call of all the messengers was Tawhid and sincerity to Allah (Exalted be He). All the prophets and messengers called for Tawhid, sincerity to Allah, believing in His Names, Attributes, and Actions. Allah (Exalted be He) is One in His Lordship, Names, Attributes, and also One in worship. No one deserves worship, neither a prophet nor a king nor a pious person, because worship is solely for Allah (Exalted be He). It is for the sake of worship that Allah (Exalted be He) created all creatures and sent the prophets, as He says: And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone). Allah (Exalted be He) says: And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût (all false deities i.e. do not worship Tâghût besides Allâh).\"",

Please inform me of your address after the end of the academic year, so as to be able to send you the answers to the rest of your questions. May Allah guide us all to know the Truth and to follow it! We seek refuge with Him from misguiding trials, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Near! You asked about the meaning of the word \"Ma`iyyah\" and here is the answer. Allah (Glorified be He) mentions two types of Ma`iyyah (Allah being with His creation): general and particular. The first is mentioned in the Ayah (Qur'anic verse): And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. The second is mentioned in the Ayah: Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us. and: I am with you both, hearing and seeing. There are other Ayahs to the same effect. Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) are of the opinion that Ma`iyyah is one of the Attributes of Allah (Glorified be He) as befits His Glory.

Allah (Glorified be He) is the Most High despite His Nearness and the Most Near despite His Highness. The two Attributes of Ma`iyyah and `Uluw - in a manner that befits Allah - do not involve Tashbih (comparison) to one of His creations or negate one another. Jahmiyyah and Mu`tazilah (deviant Islamic sects) uses the Ayahs to prove Allah's Ma`iyyah, deny Allah's `Uluw and claim that He is Omnipresent. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) denied these claims and agreed that Allah's Ma`iyyah entails His Knowledge of His servants' affairs despite His Istiwa'. That is why Allah begins and ends the Ayahs referring to general Ma`iyyah by mentioning His Knowledge in order to inform His servants that His Ma`iyyah entails His encompassing Knowledge of their affairs. Based upon this, the majority of the Salaf scholars have interpreted the Ayahs which mention Ma`iyyah as referring to Allah's Knowledge. Other scholars have discussed Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah's consensus on interpreting Ayahs talking about Ma`iyyah as referring to Allah's Knowledge and denying the claims of Jahmiyyah and Mu`tazilah, who say Allah is Omnipresent and who deny His Attributes of `Uluw and Istiwa' (May Allah curse them! How can they deny the Truth). Thus, we know that interpreting the word \"Ma`iyyah\" as Knowledge is not only the opinion of Shaykh Taqiy Al-Din only, but is also the opinion of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. The Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) wrote in his book \"Al-Wasitiyyah\" what supports the obligation of believing in the two Attributes of Allah, namely `Uluw and Ma`iyyah without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning) and false claims. You can refer to the book if you are interested. In general, the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) meant that it is obligatory to confirm the Ma`iyyah and `Uluw of Allah above the Throne in a manner that befits Him and does not compare Him to any of His creations. Al-Hafizh ibn Kathir (may Allah be merciful with him) while interpreting the Ayah: There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) he said, \"The majority of scholars agree that what is meant in this Ayah,",

These words do not negate interpreting Ma`iyyah as knowledge, since it is what is meant and intended by it. This is the true meaning of it. Ma`iyyah refers to Allah's Knowledge of all things related to the affairs of His servants, as for its manner, it is only known to Allah just as the rest of His Attributes. Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe in the Names and Attributes of Allah and understand their meanings but do not know their manner. Only Allah knows the exact manner of assuming His Attributes, as He alone knows His Dhat (Essence). Exalted and Glorified be He above the false claims of those who deny or compare His Attributes to those of humans. Imam Malik (may Allah be merciful with him) and other scholars among Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah said, \"Allah's Istiwa' is known, its manner is unknown, and believing in it is obligatory.\" This is the adopted view in relation to all of Allah's Attributes and Allah knows best. As for standing up for the teacher when he enters the classroom, many Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith) support the view that it is Makruh (reprehensible) or even Haram (prohibited). It is related on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, \"None was more beloved to them (i.e., the Companions) than the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but they did not stand up upon seeing him, for they knew how much he hated that.\" (Related by Ahmad and Al-Tirmidhy who termed the Hadith as Hasan (good), Sahih (authentic) and Gharib (a Hadith with a single narrator usually at the beginning of the chain of narration))",

Some scholars exclude from the ruling in these Hadith someone standing up to welcome a returning traveler, or a long-time friend to shake their hands or embrace them. Other scholars excluded a son standing up for his father to honor or help him, while a father may stand up for his son if he deserves it. What is meant here is standing up to greet and shake hands with the other and in this sense, the exclusion is valid and is supported by evidence from the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).It is related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim)that when Sa`d ibn Mu`adh came to pass judgment on Qurayzhah (a Jewish tribe), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), \"Stand and receive your chieftain.\" He (peace be upon him) meant ordering them to get up to greet him and help him dismount.Here is another Hadith related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadithon the authority of Ka`b ibn Malik, \"After Allah revealed the acceptance of his Tawbah (repentance to Allah), he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Masjid (mosque) while the people were sitting around him. Upon seeing Ka`b, Talhah ibn `Ubaydullah got up quickly and went to shake his hand and congratulate him for Allah's Acceptance of his Tawbah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not deny this act.\" Further, it is related by Abu Dawud, A l-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa'y with a good Sanadon the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she narrated, \"When the Prophet (peace be upon him) would visit Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), she would get up to (welcome) him, take him by the hand, kiss him, and have him sit in her seat. When she came to visit him, he (peace be upon him) would stand to (welcome) her, take her by the hand, kiss her and have her sit in his seat\". All these Hadiths clearly support the permissibility of getting up for another Muslim in these cases and prove it is not reprehensible. However, some Muslims today stand whenever their teacher enters to show him respect not to shake hands with him. They only stand up to show respect and honor then sit again. There is no doubt in the undesirability of this act. In addition, a teacher and the like should not approve of this behavior, based on the previous Hadith related on the authority of Mu`awiyah and other Hadiths. In fact, scholars, teachers, knowledge seekers, rulers and prominent figures in the community are the ones most entitled to following the Sunnah and applying its teachings.",

It is evidently true that the Prophet (peace be upon him) who conveyed the Message of Allah informed his Ummah that Allah (may He be Praised) is High above His Throne and above Heavens. This goes for the Fitrah (natural disposition) upon which Allah created all nations, whether Arabs or non-Arabs, at the times of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic period) and after Islam.

This has been made clear in the words of Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) with regard to explaining the Istiwa' with Allah's establishing Himself above the Throne. Belief in it is Wajib (obligatory) and the way it is done is only known to Allah (may He be Praised).

All the people and nations that do not move to support their brothers in Islam must bear in mind that they may also be stricken with the same afflictions that they hear about or see cutting the veins of these Muslims, and they shall find no one to support them then or help remove the oppression and torment they are under.

The early generations of this Ummah (nation) were granted honor, empowerment, and victory over their enemies, thus proving the evidence mentioned in the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of the honest Messenger (peace be upon him). Anyone who has an idea about Muslim history will be certain that what we have mentioned is true and can never be ignored; the only reason for that was the sincerity of the early generations in their belief in Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger and their defense of the Cause of Allah by word, action, and belief. Dear Muslim brothers, here are some Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) confirming this concept to be fully aware and well­informed. You can call to the Path of your Lord and draw the attention of your Muslim brothers to the factors that bring about victory and (warn them against) the causes of defeat. It is authentically narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"Verily, if Allah were to guide just one man through you, it would be better for you than red camels.\" Allah (Glorified be He) says, O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur'an) unanimously decided that supporting Allah (Glorified be He) means, supporting His religion by acting upon its teachings, calling to it and fighting those who oppose it. This is evident in another Ayah from Surah Al­Hajj in which Allah (Glorified be He) says,",

And who is better in speech than he who [says: \"My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness),\" and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allâh's (Islâmic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\"",

Since delivering scientific lectures is one of the best means of clarifying facts, presenting the merits of the subject­matter of the lecture, and expanding discussions on it, I thought that the suject of my lecture for tonight should be: \"Shari`ah: Merits and Man's Need for It\". I have chosen this subject for its great significance. It is well­known that studying the Islamic Shari`ah and relevant issues concerning its merits, benefits, and protection of servants, and every text concerning our need is indeed a great matter. In addition, our need for it is great. Understanding and paying attention to that issue is one of the most important matters. Being motivated by the importance of this subject, its significance, and our pressing need to understand it better and have more insight into it, I thought it should be the subject of my lecture. My dear brothers and sisters, my lecture has two aspects: First: Shari`ah and its merits. Second: The human need for it. I will speak about the two matters, God willing.",

What is meant here is that Muslims should consider the consequences, habits, circumstances, conditions, purposes, intentions of people in their obligations and their behavior in dealing with one another, in establishing Hudud, in commanding good and forbidding evil. Muslims should consider gaining interests, warding off evils, gaining the greater interest by forsaking the lesser interest and avoiding the greater evil by committing the lesser evil in case of being unable to avoid both of them. These are great issues examined by our perfect Shari`ah and they are undoubtedly some of its merits. Every ruler and every person who has authority over people including a judge, a Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions), a commander and the likes should hold fast to it.

Whoever contemplates the Shari`ah with its resources and sources and considers its great and just rulings, its benevolence to all creatures and its care for the poor, the needy, the young, the old and others; and even animals, Shari`ah takes care of them and prohibits oppression and transgression against them, he will come to know that it is a law descended from Allah, the All­Wise, the Worthy of all praise, the All­Knowing of the circumstances of His Servants and the Well­Acquainted with what is best for them. He will also know that the Shari`ah is one of the decisive evidence for the existence of Allah (Exalted be He), His Perfect Power, Wisdom and Knowledge and the truthfulness of His Messenger (peace be upon him), for he is the Messenger of Allah. So when you ponder on the rulings of this Shari`ah and its great concern for the servants' affairs whether rich or poor, owners or workers, ruling or ruled, and individuals or groups, you can see that it pays much attention to all of them and enacted rulings based on benefit, justice, equity, benevolence, and mercy. Indeed, it is a Shari`ah full of benefits, morals, guidance and justice. If any matter deviated from justice to injustice, from benefit to harm and from mercy to its opposite, it does not belong to the Shari`ah even if it is falsely attributed to it by Ta'wil (allegorical interpretation) as stressed in meaning by the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim (may Allah be Merciful with him). Our Shari`ah is full of mercy, justice, and wisdom. It cares mostly for the Muslims' interests and is far removed from abuse, oppression, and hardship. Whoever ponders on that which was previously mentioned, will know what I meant in the second part of the title of this lecture which explains that humans are in great need of the Shari`ah because of its great benefits. It pays much concern to the Muslims' interests during their life and after their death and paves the way which leads to survival and happiness.

So, whoever holds fast to this great Shari`ah and persists in acting according to it will survive, but whoever deviates from it will perish. Indeed, there is neither might nor power except with Allah. It is clear for any rational Muslim that all the servants of Allah are in dire need of the Shari`ah for it introduces the solutions for their problems and includes just rulings and takes a moderate stance between corrupt Marxist, atheistic, Communism, and unfair, oppressive Capitalism. It is moderate in every thing as it has a moderate economy between the communism and materialism of the atheists and the oppressive capitalism which has no limits. So Shari`ah is intermediate between two extremes, just between these two unjust matters and moderate in all aspects; there is no extremity or exceeding of the proper limits and no extremity in aversion. This great Shari`ah is moderate in spending and abstention without extravagance or wastefulness and without abstention or niggardliness. Allah (Exalted be He) says, And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. Allah (Glorified be He) says concerning the attributes of the Servants of the Most Beneficent (Allah), And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). So whoever ponders on this matter and pays attention to it will know that the Shari`ah is both a religion and a state, a book and sword, an act of `Ibadah (worship) and good treatment (of others), Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) and good deeds, spending money (in the way of Allah) and Ihsan (the perfection of Faith), obedience to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), repentance from past (sins) and performing good deeds for the future.

Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allâh) gives you! Truly, Allâh is Ever All­Hearer, All­Seer.

We seek refuge with Allah from all these allegations, as all servants are obliged to submit to the rulings of Shari`ah and its laws, in acts of worship and other aspects of life. Certainly, the state should execute the rulings of Shari`ah and submit to its authority in all things.

However, if not performing Salah behind him will lead people to miss the Jumu'ah or congregational Prayers, anyone who abstains from performing Salah behind him will be a Mubtadi', acting in opposition to the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). Similarly, if the regular Imam is appointed by rulers it will not be in the public interest to stop performing Salah behind him, in this case people should not stop performing Salah behind him; it will be preferable to perform it behind the best Imam.",

I testify that Muhammad is His servant, Messenger and His Khalil (beloved Servant) who was the best of Mujahids, the most sincere supporter, and the most truthful to His servants. Peace be upon him, his good, and purified family and his honorable Companions who dedicated themselves to Allah (Exalted be He) and fought for His Cause until He made His religion prevail by their efforts. He made the believers superior and the disbelievers inferior by them (may Allah be pleased with them, honor their final end, and made us of their followers in righteousness until the Day of Recompense.)",

It is, therefore, obligatory upon all Muslims to help and assist them with financial, physical, advisory, mediatory, or any other type of support. This is the obligatory duty of all Muslims. The state (may Allah grant it success) has urged the Saudi people to help them and has collected a great deal of aid for the Mujahidin (strivers/fighters in the Cause of Allah) and it is continuing to do this through the brothers in the kingdom. The state (may Allah grant it success) is encouraging the people to do this and helps in delivering the aid to the Mujahidin and Muhajirun (believer's who have migrated to an Islamic land), because they are in dire need of it, and this is a duty on everyone.",
