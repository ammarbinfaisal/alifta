Also, if some people stop performing Salah behind him and perform it behind someone else, in the hope that this may affect him and induce him to perform Tawbah, withdraw, or shun other people away from committing sins like his, not performing Salah behind such a man will be in the public interest, as long as the people do not miss performing the Jumu'ah or congregational Prayers. However, if not performing Salah behind him will lead people to miss the Jumu'ah or congregational Prayers, anyone who abstains from performing Salah behind him will be a Mubtadi', acting in opposition to the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). Similarly, if the regular Imam is appointed by rulers it will not be in the public interest to stop performing Salah behind him, in this case people should not stop performing Salah behind him; it will be preferable to perform it behind the best Imam.",

These forms of `Ibadah must be dedicated to Allah alone. The scholars should clarify this to people, and that dedicating these forms of `Ibadah to a prophet, a Waliy (pious person) or other creatures is considered Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah).
