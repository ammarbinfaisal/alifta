Allah will help you according to your devotion and sincerity. Our era is not like that of the Salaf (righteous predecessors). In that era, the scholars were many. If one of them refused the post, there were others to assume this post instead of him. However, in our era scholars are few and ignorance has spread. If a competent person refuses to assume the post of a judge, it is difficult to find another, and the judiciary system in the country will be affected. Undoubtedly, this will cause great harm.

It also discloses the false claims for enforcing the positive laws or that the present time is not valid for the laws of Shari`ah since the time of enforcing Shari`ah has passed. If these things and the like are the goal of making comparisons, there is no harm, for it helps to clarify the vanity of the falsehoods of those people and the invalidity of their inclinations as well as bringing confidence to hearts of Muslims regarding their religion so that they hold fast to it.

He (Glorified be He) also says: O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger (ﺻـﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴـﻪ ﻭﺳـﻠﻢ), if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination. He (Glorified be He) also says: And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge). (And say O Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭ ﺳﻠﻢ to these polytheists:) Such is Allâh, my Lord in Whom I put my trust, and to Him I turn (in all of my affairs and) in repentance.",

That is why `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), when asked about the morals of the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, The character of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was the Qur'an. These great words said by `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) guides us to the fact that his morals (peace be upon him) were based on following the commands of the Qur'an and avoiding its prohibitions, which entails adhering to the morals praised in the Qur'an and keeping away from those that are dispraised in the Qur'an. It is a great and comprehensive word.
