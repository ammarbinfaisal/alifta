As for sins, they do not prohibit eating from the animals slaughtered by people who commit any of them as long as they do not regard such sins as lawful; rather, the animals slaughtered by them are Halal on condition that they are slaughtered in the way prescribed by the Shari'ah (Islamic law). As for those who regard sins as lawful, they are considered to be Kafirs (disbelievers), such as deeming permissible to commit Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), drinking Khamr (intoxicants), Riba (usury), undutifulness to parents, false testimony, and other similar forbidden acts on which Muslims are unanimous.

If one of them refused the post, there were others to assume this post instead of him. However, in our era scholars are few and ignorance has spread. If a competent person refuses to assume the post of a judge, it is difficult to find another, and the judiciary system in the country will be affected. Undoubtedly, this will cause great harm.

It is known for anyone who has the least knowledge that the scholars are the successors of the prophets, because the prophets did not bequeath money; they left us only knowledge, and knowledge is what was indicated in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). That is why `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), when asked about the morals of the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, The character of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was the Qur'an. These great words said by `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) guides us to the fact that his morals (peace be upon him) were based on following the commands of the Qur'an and avoiding its prohibitions, which entails adhering to the morals praised in the Qur'an and keeping away from those that are dispraised in the Qur'an. It is a great and comprehensive word.

One should seek moderation in clothing; there is no need to embroider it with expensive jewels that cost lots of money, which could instead benefit the Ummah (nation based on one creed) in religious and worldly affairs. It is not permissible to hire female singers. However, if the female singer performs light songs during a period at night to express delight and happiness for the bride, there is no problem in this. Singing and beating the Duff (a tambourine­like instrument without bells) at weddings are permissible and Mustahab (desirable) provided that it does not lead to evil, and is among women only at a time of night without staying awake all night and without loudspeakers. Only regular songs that praise the bride, bridegroom, and their families are to be performed in the presence of women only. This was the tradition at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). However, boasting about hiring very expensive female singers is unacceptable and impermissible. So are loudspeakers that harm people and let them stay awake at night and cause them to miss Fajr (Dawn) Prayer. Such reprehensible act should be avoided.",

Then, he (peace be upon him) and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) would eat after. During his time, it was reported that Jabir ibn `Abdullah Al­Ansary invited the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the Day of the Battle of the Trench and prepared a small lamb and some barley. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that bread and meat be cut and invited ten men to come and eat their fill, then they left and other ten came and so on. Allah (may He be Exalted) blessed the barley and the lamb, so that a large number of people ate from the food and still some food remained that they sent to their neighbors. It is also reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave milk to Ahl­Al­Suffah (poor Muslims who lived in the Mosque and were devoted to learning). Abu Hurayrah said: \"I gave them (milk) to drink, till they were satiated. Then, the Prophet (peace be upon them) said: 'O Abu Hurayrah drink (from it).' He said: 'I did.' Then, he said: 'Drink', and I did. Then I said: 'By Him Who has sent you with the truth, I cannot drink anymore.'

Some scholars are of the opinion that it is not obligatory on the jewelry that a woman wears or lends to others, while others said that it is obligatory; and this is the sound opinion. Zakah is obligatory on jewelry if it reaches the Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) and a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) passes, according to the general meaning of the evidence. The Nisab is twenty Mithqals (1 Mithqal = 4.25 grams) of gold and 140 Mithqals of silver.

It was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two thick bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, \"Do you pay Zakah on these?\" She said, \"No.\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?\" The narrator, 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn Al­'As (may Allah be pleased with them both), said that she took them off, gave them to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, \"They are for Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) and His Messenger.\" (Related by Abu Dawud and Al­Nasa'y with a Sahih Isnad [chain of narrators]) Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.\" (Related by Abu Dawud and Al­Darqutny, and ranked as Sahih by Al­Hakim) It was related by Abu Dawud in a Hadith narrated by 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) with a Sahih Sanad (chain of narrators) that she said, \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to me and saw big silver rings on my hands. He (peace be upon him) said, 'What is this, O 'Aishah?' I said, 'I made them to adorn myself for you, O Messenger of Allah.' He (peace be upon him) said, 'Do you pay the Zakah due on them?' I said, 'No,' or 'What Allah wishes.' He (peace be upon him) said, ' They are sufficient for your (deserving) punishment of Fire.'\" This Hadith was ranked as Sahih by Al­Hakim, as was mentioned by Al­Hafizh Ibn Rajab in: \"Bulugh Al­Maram\". This is evidence that anything on which Zakah is not paid is hoarded wealth, whose owner will be tortured with on the Day of Judgment. May Allah forbid!

The article explains that the law is derived from the Shari'ah (Islamic law). It states, \"Pertaining to marriage contracts, the law stipulates that the man must not be less than 18 years old and the woman not be less than 16 years old. A fine of not less than 1,000 Dirhams and no more than 5,000 Dirhams will be imposed on anyone who violates this law. No fine will be imposed if the court finds an acceptable justification, such as preserving honor. It is also not permissible for anyone over 60 years old to marry without obtaining permission from the court, especially when there is a big age difference between the two parties and one is half the age of the other.\"",

However, if traveling becomes inevitable, those who are inclined to travel should have profound knowledge and deep perception of their religion. They should be accompanied by supervisors to monitor and supervise their behavior to prevent them from deviating to evil paths. Moreover, this should be carefully considered, and followed up until it is accomplished, since it is a great danger for a preparatory, high school, college student, or whoever falls under this ruling in doing this. Accordingly, all fields of specialization should exist inside the country to substitute for traveling abroad. Yet, if it becomes necessary to travel abroad, then students should be selected depending on their level of virtue, knowledge, prudence, and uprightness in religion. They must also be monitored, watched and fostered until they return home provided that",

The Islamic Ummah (community) bears the responsibility of preserving the Amanah (trust) of Islam and conveying it.

(p. 20, issue no. 5977) as quoted from \"Al­Syasah Al­Kuwaytiyyah\" newspaper. They wrote that a man called Muhammad Al­Masri was buried on Wednesday after he fainted and people thought he had died. On Friday, he was taken out of the grave and claimed to have seen wonders and miracles. As some people might believe this tale, I decided to warn people against it and tell them that it is a blatant lie fabricated by this man called Muhammad Al­Masri or others for malicious purposes. It is known that if a person can hear his family, the doctor and those following his procession, the doctor should have discovered that he was alive. How could he have fainted and at the same time remember everything that took place. It is also known that a person cannot live all this time in a tight, closed place. The two angels of the grave do not come to living people if they are put in the grave; they only come to the dead. Allah (Glorified be He) knows the dead from the living, and it is He who sends the angels to question the dead. This liar then described the two angels as if they were two men, not angels. The angels do not tell the dead person about their sins or rewards; they ask them about their Lord, religion, and prophet. If they give correct answers, they will be blessed. If they failed to answer, they will be tortured. The strange scenes he described were intended to make people believe his lie that he was saved from the grave, so that they pity him and help him; just pity him, or he perhaps is seeking fame",

Likewise, if he makes a third oath after making Kaffarah for the second oath, he has to make a third Kaffarah. However, if he makes several oaths for doing or abandoning several things; then he has to make a Kaffarah for each oath he breaks. For instance, if he makes an oath not to talk to so and so and not to eat from his food or not to travel to this place or said: \"By Allah, I will not talk to so and so or hit so and so,\" in this case he has to make a Kaffarah for each oath he breaks.

Say: \"Lawful unto you are At­Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful­ good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. Allah (may He be Praised) declared that He made only the good things lawful for His Servants, and smoking is not from the good lawful things; it is from the bad unlawful things which are harmful to man. Thus, your father as well as all smokers must repent to Allah (may He be Praised) of smoking and avoid sitting with smokers. A Muslim is not permitted to help any one in smoking or doing any misdeed. Allah (may He be Praised) says: Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­ Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment. It is obligatory on you, your brothers and paternal uncles to advise your father and warn him against smoking in compliance to the Ayah mentioned above and the saying of Prophet (peace be upon him) which reads: Religion is based on advising one another. Upon this we said: For whom? He replied: For Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and for the leaders and the general Muslims. Related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith. I ask Allah to guide your father to goodness and help him repent of this act and all misdeeds. I ask Him to make you an assistant in goodness; He is All­Hearer, Ever Near.",

The most prominent opinion is that it is Haram (prohibited), for Muslims are prohibited from imitating the Kafirs (disbelievers), and Allah states when describing the Kafirs of Makkah: Their Salât (prayer) at the House (of Allâh, i.e. the Ka'bah at Makkah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. Scholars state that whistling and clapping the hands were practices of Kafirs. However, when a believer sees or hears what they like or dislike, it is an act of Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) to say, \"Subhan Allah [Glorified be Allah]\" or \"Allah Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]\", as confirmed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in many Hadith. However, it is permissible for women to clap their hands, when something happens during Salah (prayer) or when they are praying behind men and the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) forgets something. In this case, it is permissible for women to warn the Imam by clapping their hands while men are to warn him by saying Tasbih (saying: \"Subhan Allah [Glory be to Allah]\"), as confirmed from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Thus, men who clap their hands are mimicking Kafirs and women, and both acts are prohibited. Allah is the Grantor of success.",

One of these means is to revise their previously-studied lessons with colleagues in order to memorize them by heart and use them to strengthen their `Aqidah (faith), manners, and efforts. Moreover, I recommend all young people to use their free time in reciting the Qur'an attentively and memorizing what they can of its Ayahs (Qur'anic verses), because the Qur'an is the source of happiness for all Muslims and the spring gushing forth goodness and guidance. Allah (Glorified be He) revealed the Qur'an as a clarification of all things and as a guide, mercy, and glad tidings to Muslims. Even more, He (Glorified be He) has made it a guide to that which is most just and right and has urged His Servants to recite it and contemplate its meanings. Allah states: Do they not then think deeply in the Qur'ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)? Allah (Exalted be He) also states: (This is) a Book (the Qur'ân) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.

They involve emulating the creation of Allah and imitating His enemies. Hanging mummified animals wastes one's money, involves imitating the enemies of Allah, and opens the way to hang human statues. The perfect Islamic Shari`ah came to block the means to Shirk and sins. The people of Noah fell into Shirk due to five images they made for five righteous people at their time.

According to the scholars, the meaning is that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam with the ability to hear, see, and speak when he wills similar to Allah, for He is All­Hearing, All­Seeing, and He speaks when He wills. Allah also has a Face, (Glorified and Exalted be He). However, this does not imply that there is any Tashbih or Tamthil between the created and the Creator. The Attributes of Allah (Exalted be He) differ from that of His creatures. This only means He is All­Hearing, All­Seeing, He speaks when He wills. Allah (Exalted be He) also created Adam able to hear and see, and with a face, hands and feet. However, human faculties of hearing, seeing, and speaking bear no resemblance to those of Allah (Exalted be He). Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) has Attributes that befit His Majesty and Might, and nothing can be compared to Him, and man has attributes that befit him; attributes that are finite and imperfect whereas the Attributes of Allah are perfect, everlasting, and infinite. Therefore, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), describes Himself, saying: There is nothing like Him; and He is the All­Hearer, the All­Seer. Allah (Exalted be He) also says \"And there is none co­equal or comparable unto Him.\" Thus, it is not permissible to slap or deform the human face.",

It is also permissible to wash them before their burial and offer funeral prayers for them. However, it is not for the ruler or the judge to offer funeral prayers for him. Rather, some common people should offer it for him as a kind of punishment for his bad conduct. If the person dies in an assault committed against him, he is wronged and funeral prayers and Du`a' (supplication) should be offered for him if he is a Muslim. Likewise, the one who dies after submitting to Qisas, funeral prayers, and Du`a' should be offered for him if he dies as a Muslim without committing what would render a person an apostate.

However, if boycotting a person might lead to greater harm such as being an influential person in the country, he should not be boycotted; he should rather be treated kindly so that boycotting him does not lead to a greater evil than his crime. The evidence for this is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not treat the chief of the hypocrites, `Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, the same way he treated Ka`b and his two companions, but he treated him nicely, being the chief of his tribe. If he had boycotted or imprisoned him, this might have led to Fitnah (trial) among his followers in Madinah. That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) treated him kindly until he died while still a hypocrite. May Allah grant us safety!",

If it is said, \"What is the wisdom behind deeming it allowable for Muslim men to get married to chaste women from the People of the Book and not allowing men from the People of the Book to get married to Muslim women?\" The answer to this is that the Muslims believe in Allah (Exalted be He), His Messengers (peace be upon them), and what was revealed to His Messengers (peace be upon them). Consequently, they believe in Musa ibn `Imran (Moses) (peace be upon him) and `Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryum (peace be upon him). They believe in the Torah revealed to Moses and the Bible revealed to Jesus. Therefore, Allah permitted Muslim men to get married to them as a favor from Him to Muslims and to perfect His benevolence on them. The people of the Book do not believe in Muhammad (peace be upon him) and what was revealed to him, namely, the Glorious Qur'an. So Allah prohibits them to get married to Muslim women unless they believe in his Prophet and Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Seal of Prophets and Messengers. When they believe in Muhammad, the Muslim women become allowed for them to get married to and they will have the rights and duties we have. Indeed, Allah (may He be Praised) is the Most Just Judge Who is aware of the affairs of His slaves and knows what makes them right. He is the All­Wise in everything (may He be exalted and glorified).

There is no evidence that the Magi have a book. Moreover, Ahmad was asked: Was it authentically reported from `Ali that a Book was revealed to the Magi? He replied that this is absolutely false. Even if they have a Book, it is evident that rules applied to the People of the Book are not applicable to those other than them. The Prophet's statement, Treat them like you treat the people of the Book... proves that they have no Book. The Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted to prevent bloodshed and let them pay Jizayah. Since their having a Divine Book is a doubtful matter, Muslims protect their lives. Thus, it is forbidden to marry a woman from them or to eat from the animals slaughtered by them. Consequently, we must favor the evidence over the opposing doubtful matter. It is not authentically established that Hudhayfah married a Magian woman. Ahmad classified the report stating that Hudhayfah married a Magian woman as weak and said that Abu Wa'il, who is more reliable than the narrator who gave the above report, mentioned that Hudhayfah married a Jewish woman. Ibn Sirin said that Hudhayfah's wife was Christian. Owing to these contradicting narrations, none of them can be authentic unless it is confirmed. Even if it is authentically established that Hudhayfah married to a Magian woman, it is impermissible to use this fact as a proof and go against the Book and the view of the other scholars.",

If it had been a commendable act to celebrate the Prophet's birthday or any person's birthday, these grand people would have hastened to celebrate birthdays and the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have instructed and urged his Ummah (nation) to do so, or would have celebrated such occasions himself.

Later, this Bid`ah spread among the people.

Also, practicing this Bid`ah involves imitation of the Jews, the Christians, and other disbelievers who are used to attend such celebrations.

I received your letter that informs of your appointment to the chairmanship of the Committee for the propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice in Dhahran. Actually, I had already known about this news and decided to write to you once I got it. However, I have been overwhelmed with many things prior to the arrival of your letter. I advise you and myself to fear Allah wherever we may be, give precedence to Allah's rights over anything else, and be truthful in dealing with Him and in offering advice to people for His sake to the best of our capacity. I advise you to consider the Divine, Shar'i principle when there is conflict between benefits and harms, as it is impossible to have all benefits or repel all harms. The principle implies that a Muslim should fulfill the greater benefit even if the lesser is left and repel the greater harm even if the lesser occurs. You are in a position that requires much attention, Shari`ah­based policies, strength in carrying out the commands of Allah, and kindness that is indispensible in some cases. Thus, fear Allah, be patient, and allow the members of your committee to encourage one another and other organizations in Al­Dammam, Khubar, Al­Thuqbah, and other governorates to trust in Allah, rely on Him, and invoke Him for victory. Remember the great harms that the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Salaf (righteous predecessors) endured in the way of Da`wah (calling to Islam) and how patient they were until Allah granted them their wishes, thwarted the plots of the enemy, supported the believing party, and disgraced the party of Satan through them.",

There is also no permissibility of taking anything harmful from animals, unlike those who eat impurities, such as pigs, predatory animals, and those having the same ruling as them. There is no injustice; no breach of the sanctity of anything declared inviolable, whether it is soul, property, or honor. We must, therefore, show gratitude to Allah for His Bounties, the most valuable of which is Islam, and supplicate to Him to support His Din, keep His Word lofty, and make us not objects of Fitnah (trial) for disbelieving people due to our negligence. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad who clearly conveyed His Message, and upon his family, Companions, and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment!",

If the Bid`ah of the Imam leading Jumu`ah prayer does not render him a non­Muslim, then Muslims are to pray behind him. It is stated by Imam Abu Ja`far Al­Tahawy (may Allah have mercy on him) in his famous book of `Aqidah: \"We opine offering prayer behind every pious and disobedient Muslim as well as offering it over those who die among them.\" Explaining this statement, the commentator on this `Aqidah [Book], who is a trustworthy scholar, cited the Prophet's (peace be upon him) statement, Perform Salah behind the Imam, be he pious or disobedient. Narrated by Mak­hul on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).It was also narrated by Al­Daraqutnywho commented: Mak­hul did not meet with Abu Hurayrah; in addition, among its chain of narrators there is Mu`awiyah ibn Salih whose authenticity is questioned. Yet, Muslim narrated this Hadithin his Sahih.Also, it is narrated by Al­Daraqutny and Abu Dawudfrom Mak­hul on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) stated, The Salah is obligatory on you behind every Muslim, pious or impious, even if he commits grave sins; Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) is incumbent on you along with every ruler, whether he is pious or impious, even if he commits grave sins. It is stated in Sahih Al­Bukharithat `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) offered Salah behind Al­Hajjaj ibn Yusuf Al­Thaqafi. Also this was the approach of Anas ibn Malik [knowing that] Al­Hajjaj was corrupt and tyrannical. It is also mentioned in Sahih Al­Bukhari that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, They will lead you in Salah; if they offer it properly, it is for you both and if they offer it inappropriately, it is for you but against them. On the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, Perform Salah behind whoever testifies, \"There is no god but Allah,\" and pray over whomever dies while professing that \"There is no god but Allah.\"",

Know ­ may Allah have mercy on you and us ­ that the scholars unanimously agreed that it is permissible for one to offer Salah led by another who is not known to have committed any Bid`ah or any act of disobedience. It is not a condition for the Ma'mum (a person being led by an Imam in Prayer) to know the beliefs of his Imam or to test him in order to know his `Aqidah (creed). Rather, the Ma'mum is to pray behind the Imam without knowing the particulars of his beliefs. If the regular Imam, such as the Imam leading Jumu`ah prayer, the prayers of the two `Eids, or the Imam leading prayer in Hajj on the Day of `Arafah, happens to be Mubtadi` (one who introduces innovations in religion) who calls people to adhere to his Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) or a manifest Fasiq (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) and the Ma'mum cannot find another Imam to offer congregational Salah behind him; in such cases the Ma'mum is required to offer prayer behind these Imams according to the opinion of the majority of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and other Muslim generations of scholars who came after them. Accordingly, the one who neglects offering Jumu`ah and congregational Salah behind a corrupt Imam is a Mubtadi` (one who introduces innovations in Islam) according to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars. The sound opinion is that one is to offer Salah behind such Imam and not to repeat offering the same Salah afterwards. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to offer Jumu`ah and congregational Salah behind wicked Imams without repeating them. Also, `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to pray behind Al­Hajjaj ibn Yusuf as well as Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) as mentioned before. `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) and other Companions used to pray behind Al­Walid ibn `Uqbah ibn Abu Mu`ayt who used to drink alcohol and as a result offered four Rak`ahs of Fajr prayer instead of two. He then suggested to offer more Rak`ahs. It was said to him by Ibn Mas`ud, \"You have already prayed more than is due.\" In Sahih Al­Bukhari, it is narrated that when `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) was placed under in house arrest, a person led people in Salah. Someone said to `Uthman, \"You are the Imam of all the Muslims but the person who led people in Salah is an Imam that will cause affliction.\" He replied, \"O nephew, verily, Salah is the best thing that people can do. Thus if they do it properly, then do it along with them. But if they do it improperly, then avoid their wrong.\"",

          "text": "The Salah of both the Fasiq (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) and the Mubtadi` (one who introduces innovations in Islam) is in itself valid. If the Ma'mum offers Salah behind such Imams, his Salah will be valid. The scholars who disapproved of performing Salah behind such Imams based their disapproval on the obligation of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. In addition, the one who publicly practices Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) and corruption is not to be appointed as a leader of Muslims because he deserves blame so that he may repent. If we can abandon him until he repents, this will be good. Some people may avoid being led by such Imam in Salah and offer it behind another Imam in hope that this will lead to resisting evil and will prompt him to repent or else be replaced, or so people may cease to imitate his evil practices. If this is the case, abandoning him will lead to a Shar`i benefit, especially that the Ma'mum will miss neither the Jumu`ah nor the congregational Salah, as they will offer them in some other Masjid (mosque) behind another Imam. However, if the Ma'mum, by doing so, will miss the Jumu`ah and the congregational Salah, his act will be that of a Mubtadi` and thus contradicting the conduct of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Also if the Imam is appointed by those in authority and there is no Shar`i benefit in not performing Salah behind him, it will not be permissible to leave Salah behind him. Rather, offering Salah behind him will even be preferable. Thus, if one can remove an aspect of evil concerning leading Salah, it is incumbent to do so. Yet, if such Imam is appointed by those in authority and one cannot stop him from leading people in Salah, or that one can stop him doing so but with greater harm, it will not be permissible to get rid of little harm by incurring a greater degree of it. Also, it is not permissible to get rid of the lesser of two evils by doing the greater of the two. The divine laws are meant to achieve and protect interests, and to eliminate evils or reduce them as much as possible. Not performing Jumu`ah and congregational Salah has greater harm than offering Salah behind a corrupt Imam, especially when missing them does not lead to the removal of corruption. In such case, the Shar`i benefit will be thwarted without removing the evil. If one can perform Jumu`ah Prayer and the congregational prayers behind a pious Imam, then this is better than offering them behind a corrupt one. As for one who prays behind a corrupt Imam without an excuse, his case is disputed by scholars; some said he has to repeat his Salah while others said he does not have to. This issue is explained in the books of Fiqh that deal with secondary questions. [Here ends the words of the commentators]. What is most accurate regarding the question mentioned above is not to repeat the Salah, due to the evidence mentioned above. In origin, repeating Salah is not required. They need not be repeated except with a special proof requiring that and we know not for sure that such proof exists. Success is only from Allah.",

My opinion is built on what Allah (Exalted be He) says concerning usurers: So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribâ (usury) shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allâh (to judge); but whoever returns [to Ribâ (usury)], such are the dwellers of the Fire ­ they will abide therein. May Allah provide all of us with refuge from that. This honorable Ayah indicates the lawfulness of the past earnings of unlawful work when Allah's slave repents to Him and does not do such work again. If you give the money or some of it in charity just to be on the safe side, this is good because the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: \"So he who guards himself against doubtful things keeps his religion and honor blameless...''

Islam gives her many duties on her husband and enjoined her father and relatives to financially assist her when necessary.

The members of the Saudi Educational Committee in Yemen asked me in 1395 A.H. about the ruling on offering Salah (Prayer) behind Al­Zaydiyyah. In Ramadan 3, 1395 A.H., I answered them that I do not advocate offering Salah behind them, for they excessively seek help from, supplicate, and make vows to Ahl­ul­Bayt (members of the Prophet's extended Muslim family). This reply was based upon what came to my knowledge that Al­Zaydiyyah overglorify Ahl­ul­Bayt through means of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as supplicating to them and seeking their help. Then I came to know in Sha`ban, 1396 A.H. that my Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) astonished many scholars in Yemen. Some of them called me, among which were graduates of the Islamic University in Al­Madinah whose knowledge and Deen I trust. They confirmed that the majority of the scholars of Al­Zaydiyyah do not excessively honor Ahl­ul­Bayt. Rather, this occurs among some laypeople of Al­Zaydiyyah who do not have enough knowledge and insight to grasp the truth of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) and Shirk. They mentioned that they know that the scholars of Al­Zaydiyyah reject overpraising Ahl­ul­Bayt and Shirk. The fact that only some scholars or laypeople of Al­Zaydiyyah may commit such kind of Shirk is not a ground to accuse them all of committing Shirk. Accordingly, I had to reconsider my Fatwa, for I must acknowledge truth, since it is the sought­after goal of every Muslim; wherever he finds it, he must follow it. Therefore,",

Seeking help from the dead, idols, Jinn, and the like is an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). However, asking for the help of living beings who can give it is permissible. Narrating the story of Musa (Moses peace be upon him), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe If you do not find an Imam to offer Salah behind , it is permissible for you to offer it home. If you find a group of Muslims who can offer Salah in the Masjid (mosque) before or after this Mushrik Imam offers it, you should offer Salah with them. If Muslims are able to fire this Imam and appoint another Muslim Imam, they should do so. This is a form of enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong to enforce Allah's Shari`ah (Law) in the land. If this is possible without creating any dispute. Allah (Exalted be He) states: The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ' (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma'rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden) Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: \"Whoever, among you, sees something abominable should rectify it with his hand. If he does not have sufficient strength, then he should change it with his tongue. If he does not have sufficient strength to do it, (even) then he should abhor it in his heart and that is the least of Faith.\" Related by Muslim in his Sahih.",

You ask about some youth who say that Allah may not be sought for help by the status of the Prophet (peace be upon him). This is correct because there is no authentic proof that permits seeking Allah's help by the status of anyone, by the rank of someone, or by the soul of anyone. However, it is not an act of polytheism, rather an innovation and one of the means to polytheism according to the majority of scholars. The Prophet (peace be upon him) holds great rank and status in the sight of Allah and in the sight of the believers. There is no sound Islam or Iman (Faith) for anyone except with the testimony of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no deity but Allah) and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. However, it is not permissible to draw near to Allah or employ Tawassul (supplicating Allah by the status of someone) except with a statement or action that Allah ordained, as the Prophet's stated: Whoever performs an action that is not in accordance with our Shari'ah, it is to be rejected.",

Unfortunately, your letter contains some errors such as attributing to Allah the following: (Allah says: the left hand is an organ in the body such as the right hand) which are not the words of Allah. And your saying: (and we have made over all those endowed with knowledge is the All­Knowing (Allah)), which is also not from the words of Allah. The Nass (Islamic text from the Qur'an or the Sunnah ) is: but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All­Knowing (Allâh).

Tawassul (supplicating to Allah in the name of/by virtue of the status of so­and­so) should be made by the Names and Attributes of Allah and by declaring Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) as reported in the following Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith): O Allah, I ask You that I bear witness that there is no god but You, the One, the Self­Sufficient Master, Who has not begotten, and has not been begotten, and to Whom no one is equal. Tawassul can also be carried out through righteous deeds, such as the incident of the people who were locked up in a cave because of a boulder which blocked the opening of the cave and made them unable to get out. One of them supplicated to Allah by virtue of his dutifulness to his parents, the second by his refraining from committing Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), and the third by fulfilling a trust. Consequently, Allah relieved them from their suffering. This indicates that Tawassul through righteous deeds is permissible and correct.",

As for the amulets that the Imam prepares, it is not permissible because the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If one wears an amulet, Allah will not accomplish their affairs for them and if one ties a cowrie shell, Allah will not protect them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: Whoever wears an amulet commits an act of Shirk. It is not permissible to make amulets or wear them. Whoever makes amulets or wears them must be repudiated even if these amulets include Ayahs (Qur'anic verses). `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud and another group of Salaf (righteous predecessors) used to disapprove of amulets, whether they included Ayahs or not, because of the general meaning of the previously­quoted Hadith and because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Verily, incantations, amulets, and love charms are forms of Shirk. Incantations refer to the recitation of meaningless words or incantations which consist of Shirk. The permissible incantations, on the other hand, are the lawful Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: There is no harm in the incantation that does not contain Shirk. Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) made Ruqyah and Ruqyah was made for him. Love charms are a kind of sorcery; they are also known as Al­Sarf and Al­`Atf (spells aimed at creating hatred or love), and they are prohibited. Amulets are also prohibited and they are also known as Al­Jawami` and Al­Huruz (the preservers). The Messenger (peace be upon him) forbade amulets and allowed no exceptions regarding them; he even called them acts of Shirk and supplicated to Allah against anyone who wears amulets. Also, claiming that it is permissible to wear amulets including Ayahs or lawful supplications and Shar`y (Islamically lawful) Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) is a baseless exception and a means that may lead to wearing other Shirk­ entailing amulets. It is well­known that the Shari`ah obligates the application of the general rulings as long as there is no evidence on making them specific. Furthermore, the purified Shari`ah (Islamic law) obligates blocking the means leading to sins or Shirk. If amulets including Ayahs are worn,",

This is an impermissible and rejected Bid'ah, whether it takes one day or more. There is no Shar'y (Islamic legal) foundation for this practice. Rather, it is an act of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance); it was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"Four practices characteristic of Jahiliyyah that are found in my Ummah (nation based on one creed), which they will not abandon: taking pride in noble descent, impugning lineage, ascribing the falling of rain to the stars, and wailing.\" And \"If the wailing woman does not repent before she dies, she will be raised on the Day of Resurrection wearing a garment of tar and a shirt of mange.\" (Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])",

There are two opinions of which the more likely to be correct is that it does not reach the dead, for there is no evidence to this effect. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not do this for the dead Muslims such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, nor did the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) (may Allah be pleased with them). Therefore, it is preferable that the Mu'min (believer) refrain from reciting the Qur'an, either on behalf of the dead or the living, or offer Salah or Sawm (Fast) on their behalf, for there is no evidence to support any of these deeds. The acts of 'Ibadah (worship) are based upon Tawqif (a religious text and not personal opinion), except for what is authentically reported from Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him) to be Shar'y (Islamically permissible). As for Sadaqah and Du'a', they benefit the living and the dead by the Ijma' (consensus) of Muslims. The Hadith stated specifically tackle the dead, for this was the controversial matter: whether or not it will benefit the dead. Hence, the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to clarify this: \"When a person dies, their works (righteous acts) come to an end, apart from three: Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), beneficial knowledge, or a pious son who supplicates for them (the deceased).\" As it is well known that one's deeds come to an end by death, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) mentioned the deeds that do not end by death.",

It is authentically reported that: A woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah upon His servants has become due on my father when he is an old man and cannot sit firm on the back of the mount. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"Yes, perform Hajj on his behalf.\" Another man came and said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! My father is a very old man who does not have strength to perform Hajj or ' Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) or to undertake the journey?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"You may perform Hajj and 'Umrah on behalf of your father.\" This indicates that it is permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of the dead or living people who are unable because of old age.

However, anyone who delays Sawm in Ramadan due to a Shar'y (Islamic legal) excuse, such as illness or travel, and then dies before making up for them, there is no need to make up on their behalf for the missed Swam or to feed poor people, since they are excused. As for you, dear questioner, you are doing good In sha'a­Allah (if Allah wills) by being dutiful to your parents and giving Sadaqah and making Du'a' for them. This is especially true if the son is righteous, for his Du'a' is more likely to be accepted than an unrighteous one. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: \"or a pious son who supplicates for them (the deceased parent),\" since the pious child is more apt to have his Du'a' answered than one who is wicked. Nevertheless, Du'a' is required from both, but the Du'a' of the righteous is more likely to be accepted.",

These people are the ones whose fear of Allah is the most perfect, and whose piety and obedience to Him the most perfect. At the head of them are the Messengers and Prophets (peace be upon them all). Thus, the meaning of the Ayah, It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allâh. is perfect fear shown by servants who have knowledge. They are those who know their Lord through His Names, His Attributes, and His Great Right (Glorified and Exalted be He). They are those who understand His Shari'ah (Divine Law), believe in the blessings He prepared for those who fear Him and in the punishment for those who disobey Him and violate His Orders. Due to their perfect knowledge of Allah and the Truth, they are, of all people, the most fearful of Allah and the most reverential to Him (Glorified and Exalted be He). The Ayah does not mean that only scholars fear Allah for every believing man and woman fear Allah (Glorified be He) and feel reverent awe for Him (Exalted be He). However, fear varies from one person to another as people are not equal. The more a believing man knows Allah and has deep understanding of His Religion, the more he fears Him and the more his fear is perfect. Likewise, the more a believing woman knows Allah, His Attributes, and His Great Rights, the more she fears Him and the more her fear is perfect. The less knowledge and awareness people have, the less they fear Allah and the less they feel awe for Him (Exalted be He). People vary in the degree of their fear of Allah, even the scholars; the more a scholar knows Allah, His Rights, His Religion, His Names, and His Attributes, the more perfect is his fear than those below him in these qualities. The less knowledge a person has, the less he fears Allah. But all the believing men and women fear Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).",

However, the perfect fear of Allah is that of people of knowledge, for their profound awareness and great knowledge of Allah. This is why they are the most fearful of Allah among mankind.

However, these three crimes are in different levels. The crime of Shirk is the worst crime and the gravest sin and the person who commits it will stay in Hell eternally forever and will never be brought out of it according to the Ijma' (consensus) of scholars. Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Glorious Book: It is not for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), to maintain the Mosques of Allâh (i.e. to pray and worship Allâh therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building,), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide. But if they had joined in worship others with Allâh, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them. And indeed it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad peace be upon him), as it was to those (Allâh's Messengers) before you: \"If you join others in worship with Allâh, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.\" Allah also says concerning them: They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment. There are many Ayahs that stress this same meaning. If a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) dies while persisting in Shirk and does not make Tawbah (repentance to Allah), they will stay in Hell forever and will be deprived of Paradise and Allah's Forgiveness by the Ijma' (consensus) of Muslim scholars. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills Allah (Exalted be He) declares in these Ayahs that those who ascribe partners to Him will be deprived of His Forgiveness",

Indeed, all these acts are classified as major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam) and if a person dies persisting in them, they will be among the dwellers of Hell. May Allah protect us from this! Also, such a person will abide there forever. As for the second and third crimes, namely killing and Zina, they are less serious than Shirk, but they are the gravest sins following Shirk as long as the person who commits them does not consider them to be Halal (lawful), but is aware that they are Haram (forbidden), yet is driven by anger, desire or other impulses to commit murder; or driven by desire and incitement of Satan to commit Zina, while they know that killing without a just cause is prohibited and that Zina is also prohibited. Accordingly, those who fall in these two major crimes are threatened with the punishment stated in the aforementioned Ayah, unless Allah (Exalted be He) forgives them or accepts their sincere Tawbah before their death. Indeed, due to the grossness of these two crimes and the corruption that results from them, Allah (Exalted be He) mentions them side by side with the crime of Shirk in this Ayah.

It is evident that the Hadith means that Muslims should revive and manifest a deserted act of Sunnah. For example, if one of the scholars visits a country where the Qur'an is being taught but the Sunnah is not, he should gather people to teach them the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah or bring teachers to do so on his behalf to revive this act of Sunnah. If another one is in a country where its people shave or cut the beards. He should advise them to let the beards grow aiming at reviving this act of Sunnah. His reward will be equivalent to that of those who follow him in this guidance. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Trim closely the moustache and let the beard grow ­ do the opposite of the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).\" (Agreed upon its authenticity by Al­Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar [may Allah be pleased with them])When this scholar lets his beard grow, calls people to do so, and they follow him, he then revives a stressed Sunnah which should not be abandoned according to the said Hadith and the other narrations to that effect.

In addition, one has to give back the rights to the parties wronged or ask for their forgiveness, such as saying, \"My brother, forgive me,\" or \"Pardon me,\" or making similar apologies. This is based upon the Hadith mentioned by the questioner and many other Hadiths and Ayahs (Qur'anic verses). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Anyone who has wronged his brother in his honour or anything, let him ask his forgiveness for it today before the time (i.e., the Day of Resurrection) when there will be no Dinar or a Dirham (to compensate for the wrong deed). If he has any righteous deeds, it will be taken from them in proportion to the wrong he did; and if he has not any righteous deeds, some of the bad deeds of his companion will be taken and burdened on him.\" (Related by Al­Bukhari in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])Believers must be keen to absolve themselves from accountability for rights violated by giving them back to their owners or by asking for their pardon. If they violated someone's honor, they should ask forgiveness for it, if they can. But if they cannot or are afraid of the negative consequences, and that telling the person may cause greater harm, they should ask Allah's Forgiveness for that person, supplicate to Allah for them, and mention their merits instead of the evils they mentioned about them in the past. They should wash away the former bad deed by later good deeds by mentioning the good things they know about them and spreading their merits in place of the demerits they formerly mentioned, and by asking Allah's Forgiveness and supplicating for them. In this way, they can end this problem.",

This applies only to Muslims, because when a Muslim does these good deeds seeking the Good Pleasure of Allah, this can be a means to salvation from Hellfire. There are many means for gaining salvation from Hellfire and admittance to Jannah, so believers should try to attain as much of them as they can. Islam itself is the only source and the basic cause for gaining admittance to Jannah and salvation from Hellfire. There are actions which, if the Muslim does them, he will enter Jannah and be saved from Hell, among them is taking care of daughters or sisters, for they will be a protection for him against Hellfire: \"Whoever suffers the death of three children who have not yet reached puberty, they will be a protection for him against Hellfire. They said, \"O Messenger of Allah, what about two?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"And two.\" But they did not ask him about one child. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Allah (may He be Exalted) says: My believing servant shall have no other reward from Me if I take his bosom companion from the people of this world, then he patiently bears it with the hope of reward, except Paradise.\" Thus, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies that a believing servant shall have no less a reward from Him than Jannah, if when He takes the one whom he loves of the people of this world, the bereaved bears it patiently, hopeful of reward. A little children of ours who dies before puberty is included in this Hadith. Thus, when a child dies and his father or mother or both endure it patiently, hopeful of reward, they will attain Jannah. This is a great bounty from Allah. The same applies to husbands, wives, and all other relatives and friends, if they are patient and hope for reward, then they are included in this Hadith, so long as they take care to avoid anything which may prevent that, such as dying while still persisting in a major sin.

Allah (Exalted be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). Allah (He may be Praised) explains that one of the conditions of admitting people to Paradise and erasing their sins is to avoid the grievous sins. Allah (Exalted be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). This indicates that whoever does not avoid them will not have this outcome because the statement: If you avoid is a condition and its consequent result is: We shall expiate from you your (small) sins This is a rule that the outcome is dependent on fulfilling the condition. Once the condition is fulfilled, the outcome and reward will follow; otherwise they will not occur. So a believer must keep away and avoid the grievous sins.",

This Hadith is in conformity with the previous Ayah. One time when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was performing Wudu' (ablution), he mentioned that whoever performs Wudu' perfectly, his previous sins shall be forgiven as long as one avoids Al-Maqtalah (i.e. grievous sins). So, a believer must strive to do good, compete in righteous acts, and avoid sins, especially, the grievous ones because their danger is great unless Allah forgives them as long as they are not one of the acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).

Thus, if a Muslim visits another Muslim or non-Muslim for the purpose of calling them to Allah, teaching them and guiding them to goodness without seeking worldly gain or taking the Commands of Allah lightly, this is a good act. It is good for a Muslim woman to visit her sister in Islam and advise her to avoid Tabarruj (women dressed immodestly in violation of the Islamic dress code), unveiling the face or taking lightly what Allah prohibits. Similarly, it is good to visit her Christian or non-Christian female neighbor, such as a Buddhist woman or the like, to advise, teach, or instruct her. Actually, this comes under the heading of the Prophet's words: \"Religion is sincerity (well-wishing). Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.\" If she responds positively, all praise is to Allah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not serve any useful purpose. Visiting for the purpose of gaining worldly benefits, playing, exchanging idle talks, eating or the like is not permissible to be made to non-Muslims, whether they are Christians or others. Such visits may corrupt one's religious commitment or morals, because the Kafirs (disbelievers) are enemies to us and we do not feel love towards them [as a reaction for their Shirk, disbelief, rejection of truth, enmity, sinning, transgression against Allah, etc. Ed]. Thus, we should not take them as protectors or confidants. However, visits are required when they are made for the purpose of calling to Allah, urging to do goodness, and warning against evil. In Surah (Qur'anic chapter) Al-Mumtahinah, Allah (may He be Praised) says: Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: \"Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone\"",

The Prophet (peace be upon him) stood up for Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) and she did the same with him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to stand up for Sa`d ibn Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) when he came to give his judgment on Banu Qurayzhah. Also, Talhah Ibn `Ubaydullah (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) upon the arrival of Ka`b Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) after Allah accepted his repentance. Talhah shook hands with him, congratulated him, and sat down again. Standing up for people in such a manner is of the high moral standards that a Muslim is allowed to do. Standing for one another out of glorification is not acceptable in Islam. Yet, it is permissible to stand up for a guest to receive him, shake hands with him, and greet him. A Muslim should not stand up for another Muslim while people are sitting without receiving or shaking hands with him. It becomes totally unacceptable when he stands up for a Muslim, who is sitting down, not for the purpose of guarding him, but out of glorification only.",

These rulings include, for instance, regulations concerning inheritance, Zakah (obligatory charity), Sawm (fasting), and the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers, and other ordinances which are ordained by Allah and agreed upon by the Muslim Ummah (nation). Adherence to these eternal decisive rulings is binding upon Muslims, from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and until the Day of Resurrection. Among these rulings is the extra share of the inheritance given in certain circumstances to male heirs, the sons, the male offspring of the sons, the agnate and uterine brothers and to the father. It is obligatory to abide by these rulings, which are part of one's faith, as stated in the Qur'an and as agreed upon by Muslim scholars. Whoever claims that overlooking these rulings leads to more well­being, or deliberately supports such claim, is considered Kafir (disbeliever). For, this would be a blatant opposition to Allah's command (may He be Praised), His Messenger's Sunnah (peace be upon him), and Ijma` (consensus of scholars) of the Ummah. The ruler of the Muslim Ummah must ask the upholders of such claim to perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah), if they are Muslims. Else, they would become subject to capital punishment, for committing apostasy. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Whoever changes his religion (Islam) must be executed. (Related by Al Bukhari) May Allah keep us and all Muslims safe from misleading trials and from contravening the divine Shari`ah.",

Before I came to China, I heard that a Muslim is not permitted to eat from the animals that atheists slaughter, or better said, killed. There is a cafeteria serving meat to Muslim students at the University but I am not certain if the animals are slaughtered in the Islamic manner. I am in doubt but my colleagues are not and eat from them. Is it permissible for Muslims to eat such food? Moreover, there is no distinction between the utensils in which food is offered to Muslims and non­Muslims. What should a Muslim do in this case?",

For example, if a person commits murder, will one remain in Hell forever? We hope that you give us a detailed explanation of this Noble Ayah.",
