One should seek moderation in clothing; there is no need to embroider it with expensive jewels that cost lots of money, which could instead benefit the Ummah (nation based on one creed) in religious and worldly affairs. It is not permissible to hire female singers. However, if the female singer performs light songs during a period at night to express delight and happiness for the bride, there is no problem in this. Singing and beating the Duff (a tambourineÂ­like instrument without bells) at weddings are permissible and Mustahab (desirable) provided that it does not lead to evil, and is among women only at a time of night without staying awake all night and without loudspeakers. Only regular songs that praise the bride, bridegroom, and their families are to be performed in the presence of women only. This was the tradition at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). However, boasting about hiring very expensive female singers is unacceptable and impermissible. So are loudspeakers that harm people and let them stay awake at night and cause them to miss Fajr (Dawn) Prayer. Such reprehensible act should be avoided.",

Any remaining food should be given to charitable societies or poor workers who may accept them. The remaining food should be delivered to those who could benefit from it; it should not be thrown in the garbage near impure things. The food should be delivered to the needy. If there are no needy people, the remaining food should be put in a pure place, not on roads or with impurities, so that some people or animals may come to eat from it. This is a way to keep food from being desecrated when there is no one to take it. However, if there are workers or poor people, the remaining food should be delivered to them.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) was occasionally invited for banquets and would invite people and order them to eat and they did till they become satiated. Then, he (peace be upon him) and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) would eat after. During his time, it was reported that Jabir ibn `Abdullah AlÂ­Ansary invited the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the Day of the Battle of the Trench and prepared a small lamb and some barley. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that bread and meat be cut and invited ten men to come and eat their fill, then they left and other ten came and so on. Allah (may He be Exalted) blessed the barley and the lamb, so that a large number of people ate from the food and still some food remained that they sent to their neighbors. It is also reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave milk to AhlÂ­AlÂ­Suffah (poor Muslims who lived in the Mosque and were devoted to learning). Abu Hurayrah said: \"I gave them (milk) to drink, till they were satiated. Then, the Prophet (peace be upon them) said: 'O Abu Hurayrah drink (from it).' He said: 'I did.' Then, he said: 'Drink', and I did. Then I said: 'By Him Who has sent you with the truth, I cannot drink anymore.' Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) drank what remained.\" This provides evidence that it is permissible to be satiated with food and drink without causing any harm.",

Some scholars are of the opinion that it is not obligatory on the jewelry that a woman wears or lends to others, while others said that it is obligatory; and this is the sound opinion. Zakah is obligatory on jewelry if it reaches the Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) and a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) passes, according to the general meaning of the evidence. The Nisab is twenty Mithqals (1 Mithqal = 4.25 grams) of gold and 140 Mithqals of silver.

Zakah is oneÂ­quarter of oneÂ­tenth (2.5%), which means 25 out of every 1000 every Hawl. It was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two thick bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, \"Do you pay Zakah on these?\" She said, \"No.\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?\" The narrator, 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn AlÂ­'As (may Allah be pleased with them both), said that she took them off, gave them to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, \"They are for Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) and His Messenger.\" (Related by Abu Dawud and AlÂ­Nasa'y with a Sahih Isnad [chain of narrators]) Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.\" (Related by Abu Dawud and AlÂ­Darqutny, and ranked as Sahih by AlÂ­Hakim) It was related by Abu Dawud in a Hadith narrated by 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) with a Sahih Sanad (chain of narrators) that she said, \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to me and saw big silver rings on my hands. He (peace be upon him) said, 'What is this, O 'Aishah?' I said, 'I made them to adorn myself for you, O Messenger of Allah.' He (peace be upon him) said, 'Do you pay the Zakah due on them?' I said, 'No,' or 'What Allah wishes.' He (peace be upon him) said, ' They are sufficient for your (deserving) punishment of Fire.'\" This Hadith was ranked as Sahih by AlÂ­Hakim, as was mentioned by AlÂ­Hafizh Ibn Rajab in: \"Bulugh AlÂ­Maram\". This is evidence that anything on which Zakah is not paid is hoarded wealth, whose owner will be tortured with on the Day of Judgment. May Allah forbid!

We also ask Allah (may He be Praised) to guide us, you, and all the Muslims together to do what is in the good of Islam and to let us all die committed to it. He is AllÂ­Hearer, EverÂ­Near.

The article explains that the law is derived from the Shari'ah (Islamic law). It states, \"Pertaining to marriage contracts, the law stipulates that the man must not be less than 18 years old and the woman not be less than 16 years old. A fine of not less than 1,000 Dirhams and no more than 5,000 Dirhams will be imposed on anyone who violates this law. No fine will be imposed if the court finds an acceptable justification, such as preserving honor. It is also not permissible for anyone over 60 years old to marry without obtaining permission from the court, especially when there is a big age difference between the two parties and one is half the age of the other.\"",

However, if traveling becomes inevitable, those who are inclined to travel should have profound knowledge and deep perception of their religion. They should be accompanied by supervisors to monitor and supervise their behavior to prevent them from deviating to evil paths. Moreover, this should be carefully considered, and followed up until it is accomplished, since it is a great danger for a preparatory, high school, college student, or whoever falls under this ruling in doing this. Accordingly, all fields of specialization should exist inside the country to substitute for traveling abroad. Yet, if it becomes necessary to travel abroad, then students should be selected depending on their level of virtue, knowledge, prudence, and uprightness in religion. They must also be monitored, watched and fostered until they return home provided that",

The Islamic Ummah (community) bears the responsibility of preserving the Amanah (trust) of Islam and conveying it. If we provide the Muslim children with knowledge and faith, and accustom them to practice it from childhood, we will not be worry about them as long as they remain on Allah's path, glorify it, follow its teachings and oppose what contradicts it. On the contrary, their enemies will fear them, as Allah (Glorified be He) states, O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) AllÃ¢h, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.

(p. 20, issue no. 5977) as quoted from \"AlÂ­Syasah AlÂ­Kuwaytiyyah\" newspaper. They wrote that a man called Muhammad AlÂ­Masri was buried on Wednesday after he fainted and people thought he had died. On Friday, he was taken out of the grave and claimed to have seen wonders and miracles. As some people might believe this tale, I decided to warn people against it and tell them that it is a blatant lie fabricated by this man called Muhammad AlÂ­Masri or others for malicious purposes. It is known that if a person can hear his family, the doctor and those following his procession, the doctor should have discovered that he was alive. How could he have fainted and at the same time remember everything that took place. It is also known that a person cannot live all this time in a tight, closed place. The two angels of the grave do not come to living people if they are put in the grave; they only come to the dead. Allah (Glorified be He) knows the dead from the living, and it is He who sends the angels to question the dead. This liar then described the two angels as if they were two men, not angels. The angels do not tell the dead person about their sins or rewards; they ask them about their Lord, religion, and prophet. If they give correct answers, they will be blessed. If they failed to answer, they will be tortured. The strange scenes he described were intended to make people believe his lie that he was saved from the grave, so that they pity him and help him; just pity him, or he perhaps is seeking fame",
