The correct opinion is that it is permissible to establish Jumu`ah Prayer with three persons at least if they are residents of a village wherein Jumu`ah is not performed. As for specifying the number of worshippers as forty, twelve, less or more than this in order for Jumu`ah prayer to be established, there is no reliable evidence for this as far as we know. What is obligatory is that it should be performed in congregation by three persons or more. This is the opinion of a group of people of knowledge, which was adopted by Sheikh­ul­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). This is the correct view as stated previously.",

My opinion is built on what Allah (Exalted be He) says concerning usurers: So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribâ (usury) shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allâh (to judge); but whoever returns [to Ribâ (usury)], such are the dwellers of the Fire ­ they will abide therein. May Allah provide all of us with refuge from that. This honorable Ayah indicates the lawfulness of the past earnings of unlawful work when Allah's slave repents to Him and does not do such work again. If you give the money or some of it in charity just to be on the safe side, this is good because the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: \"So he who guards himself against doubtful things keeps his religion and honor blameless...'' As for charity, I find no clear­cut evidence proving this obligation.",

The members of the Saudi Educational Committee in Yemen asked me in 1395 A.H. about the ruling on offering Salah (Prayer) behind Al­Zaydiyyah. In Ramadan 3, 1395 A.H., I answered them that I do not advocate offering Salah behind them, for they excessively seek help from, supplicate, and make vows to Ahl­ul­Bayt (members of the Prophet's extended Muslim family). This reply was based upon what came to my knowledge that Al­Zaydiyyah overglorify Ahl­ul­Bayt through means of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as supplicating to them and seeking their help. Then I came to know in Sha`ban, 1396 A.H. that my Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) astonished many scholars in Yemen. Some of them called me, among which were graduates of the Islamic University in Al­Madinah whose knowledge and Deen I trust. They confirmed that the majority of the scholars of Al­Zaydiyyah do not excessively honor Ahl­ul­Bayt. Rather, this occurs among some laypeople of Al­Zaydiyyah who do not have enough knowledge and insight to grasp the truth of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) and Shirk. They mentioned that they know that the scholars of Al­Zaydiyyah reject overpraising Ahl­ul­Bayt and Shirk. The fact that only some scholars or laypeople of Al­Zaydiyyah may commit such kind of Shirk is not a ground to accuse them all of committing Shirk. Accordingly, I had to reconsider my Fatwa, for I must acknowledge truth, since it is the sought­after goal of every Muslim; wherever he finds it, he must follow it. Therefore,",

It is permissible to offer Salah behind one who is not known for this, whether he is of Al­Zaydiyyah or other Muslim sects. The basic rule is that the Muslim is free from what necessarily prevents offering Salah behind him and is free from Shirk unless there is the clear and just evidence proves his committing of Shirk or his belief in its permissibility, as I now declare to our brothers in Yemen and elsewhere. As mentioned before, truth is the objective of every Muslim; wherever he finds it, he should follow it. It is well­known that Allah and His Messengers are infallible concerning what they convey from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Any Mufti (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) or seeker of knowledge is liable to err. However, he should return to the truth after realizing it. This is honorable and favorable for this is the way of the people of knowledge from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) till today. They are appreciated and praised for doing so. This is what we should all do in all circumstances. I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to guide us to what pleases Him and to guide us and all our brothers in Yemen and elsewhere to correctly convey the truth in our words and deeds! He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is All­Hearing and Near. May Allah's Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!",

Seeking help from the dead, idols, Jinn, and the like is an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). However, asking for the help of living beings who can give it is permissible. Narrating the story of Musa (Moses peace be upon him), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe If you do not find an Imam to offer Salah behind , it is permissible for you to offer it home. If you find a group of Muslims who can offer Salah in the Masjid (mosque) before or after this Mushrik Imam offers it, you should offer Salah with them. If Muslims are able to fire this Imam and appoint another Muslim Imam, they should do so. This is a form of enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong to enforce Allah's Shari`ah (Law) in the land. If this is possible without creating any dispute. Allah (Exalted be He) states: The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ' (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma'rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden) Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: \"Whoever, among you, sees something abominable should rectify it with his hand. If he does not have sufficient strength, then he should change it with his tongue. If he does not have sufficient strength to do it, (even) then he should abhor it in his heart and that is the least of Faith.\" Related by Muslim in his Sahih.",

You ask about some youth who say that Allah may not be sought for help by the status of the Prophet (peace be upon him). This is correct because there is no authentic proof that permits seeking Allah's help by the status of anyone, by the rank of someone, or by the soul of anyone. However, it is not an act of polytheism, rather an innovation and one of the means to polytheism according to the majority of scholars. The Prophet (peace be upon him) holds great rank and status in the sight of Allah and in the sight of the believers. There is no sound Islam or Iman (Faith) for anyone except with the testimony of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no deity but Allah) and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. However, it is not permissible to draw near to Allah or employ Tawassul (supplicating Allah by the status of someone) except with a statement or action that Allah ordained, as the Prophet's stated: Whoever performs an action that is not in accordance with our Shari'ah, it is to be rejected.",

In Surah Al­Furqan, Allah states, Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur'ân) to His slave (Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) that he may be a warner to the ' Alamîn (mankind and jinn). Allah (Glorified be He) also says: Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion It means that Allah (may He be Praised) has the maximum degree of sublimity and blessing. A servant, on the other hand, is blessed, if Allah guides, rectifies, and makes him a benefit to people. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states about His Servant and Messenger `Isa, the son of Mariam, (peace be upon him), \"He ['Isâ (Jesus)] said: \"Verily I am a slave of Allâh, He has given And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be May Allah grant us me the Scripture and made me a Prophet;\" success!",

For example, it is not permissible to say, \"O Allah! I ask You by virtue of the status of Your Prophets or of Your Waliy (pious person) or Servant so­ and­so, or by the right or blessing of so­and­so.\" In fact, this is a Bid`ah and a means leading to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) because it was neither reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Sahabah (Companions). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them Allah has not said, \"so call on Him by the blessing or the virtue of the status of so­and­so.\" It is authentically reported from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) that he said: Whoever does any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf will have it rejected. Tawassul (supplicating to Allah in the name of/by virtue of the status of so­and­so) should be made by the Names and Attributes of Allah and by declaring Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) as reported in the following Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith): O Allah, I ask You that I bear witness that there is no god but You, the One, the Self­Sufficient Master, Who has not begotten, and has not been begotten, and to Whom no one is equal. Tawassul can also be carried out through righteous deeds, such as the incident of the people who were locked up in a cave because of a boulder which blocked the opening of the cave and made them unable to get out. One of them supplicated to Allah by virtue of his dutifulness to his parents, the second by his refraining from committing Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), and the third by fulfilling a trust. Consequently, Allah relieved them from their suffering. This indicates that Tawassul through righteous deeds is permissible and correct.",

As for the amulets that the Imam prepares, it is not permissible because the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If one wears an amulet, Allah will not accomplish their affairs for them and if one ties a cowrie shell, Allah will not protect them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: Whoever wears an amulet commits an act of Shirk. It is not permissible to make amulets or wear them. Whoever makes amulets or wears them must be repudiated even if these amulets include Ayahs (Qur'anic verses). `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud and another group of Salaf (righteous predecessors) used to disapprove of amulets, whether they included Ayahs or not, because of the general meaning of the previously­quoted Hadith and because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Verily, incantations, amulets, and love charms are forms of Shirk. Incantations refer to the recitation of meaningless words or incantations which consist of Shirk. The permissible incantations, on the other hand, are the lawful Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: There is no harm in the incantation that does not contain Shirk. Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) made Ruqyah and Ruqyah was made for him. Love charms are a kind of sorcery; they are also known as Al­Sarf and Al­`Atf (spells aimed at creating hatred or love), and they are prohibited. Amulets are also prohibited and they are also known as Al­Jawami` and Al­Huruz (the preservers). The Messenger (peace be upon him) forbade amulets and allowed no exceptions regarding them; he even called them acts of Shirk and supplicated to Allah against anyone who wears amulets. Also, claiming that it is permissible to wear amulets including Ayahs or lawful supplications and Shar`y (Islamically lawful) Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) is a baseless exception and a means that may lead to wearing other Shirk­ entailing amulets. It is well­known that the Shari`ah obligates the application of the general rulings as long as there is no evidence on making them specific. Furthermore, the purified Shari`ah (Islamic law) obligates blocking the means leading to sins or Shirk. If amulets including Ayahs are worn,",

The wisdom behind forbidding amulets is to make hearts attached to none but Allah. Moreover, wearing amulets including Ayahs is a means to wear other amulets as well. Accordingly, it is obligatory to prevent all Muslims, even children and sick people from wearing amulets, whether they include Ayahs or not. Rather, Shar`y supplications must be taught to them, such as seeking refuge with Allah's Perfect Words from the evil of what He created, reciting Ayat­ul­Kursy (the Qur'anic Verse of Allah's Chair, Surah Al­Baqarah, 2:255), and reciting Surah Al­Ikhlas and Al­Mu`awwidhatayn (Surahs Al­Falaq and Al­Nas) when going to bed and after the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers.
