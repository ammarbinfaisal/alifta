          "text": "A: This is a great Ayah (Qur'anic verse) which indicates that people of knowledge are those endowed with the knowledge of Allah, His Religion i.e. Islam, His Glorious Book and the Sunnah of His honorable Prophet (peace be upon him). These people are the ones whose fear of Allah is the most perfect, and whose piety and obedience to Him the most perfect. At the head of them are the Messengers and Prophets (peace be upon them all). Thus, the meaning of the Ayah, It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allâh. is perfect fear shown by servants who have knowledge. They are those who know their Lord through His Names, His Attributes, and His Great Right (Glorified and Exalted be He). They are those who understand His Shari'ah (Divine Law), believe in the blessings He prepared for those who fear Him and in the punishment for those who disobey Him and violate His Orders. Due to their perfect knowledge of Allah and the Truth, they are, of all people, the most fearful of Allah and the most reverential to Him (Glorified and Exalted be He). The Ayah does not mean that only scholars fear Allah for every believing man and woman fear Allah (Glorified be He) and feel reverent awe for Him (Exalted be He). However, fear varies from one person to another as people are not equal. The more a believing man knows Allah and has deep understanding of His Religion, the more he fears Him and the more his fear is perfect. Likewise, the more a believing woman knows Allah, His Attributes, and His Great Rights, the more she fears Him and the more her fear is perfect. The less knowledge and awareness people have, the less they fear Allah and the less they feel awe for Him (Exalted be He). People vary in the degree of their fear of Allah, even the scholars; the more a scholar knows Allah, His Rights, His Religion, His Names, and His Attributes, the more perfect is his fear than those below him in these qualities. The less knowledge a person has, the less he fears Allah. But all the believing men and women fear Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).",

The believers, scholars or common people, shall be rewarded for their fear of Allah. However, the perfect fear of Allah is that of people of knowledge, for their profound awareness and great knowledge of Allah. This is why they are the most fearful of Allah among mankind.

Therefore, Muslims must not despair of Allah's Mercy or feel safe from His Plan and Punishment; rather, every Muslim should walk to Allah in this transient worldly life with fear and hope. They must be mindful of His Might, and the severity of His Punishment for violating His Command; thus, they will fear Him and avoid His Punishment. At the same time, they must remember His Mercy, Pardon, Forgiveness, Generosity and Bounty; accordingly, they will expect good from Allah and be filled with hope of His bounty and Forgiveness.

However, these three crimes are in different levels. The crime of Shirk is the worst crime and the gravest sin and the person who commits it will stay in Hell eternally forever and will never be brought out of it according to the Ijma' (consensus) of scholars. Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Glorious Book: It is not for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), to maintain the Mosques of Allâh (i.e. to pray and worship Allâh therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building,), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide. But if they had joined in worship others with Allâh, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them. And indeed it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad peace be upon him), as it was to those (Allâh's Messengers) before you: \"If you join others in worship with Allâh, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.\" Allah also says concerning them: They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment. There are many Ayahs that stress this same meaning. If a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) dies while persisting in Shirk and does not make Tawbah (repentance to Allah), they will stay in Hell forever and will be deprived of Paradise and Allah's Forgiveness by the Ijma' (consensus) of Muslim scholars. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills Allah (Exalted be He) declares in these Ayahs that those who ascribe partners to Him will be deprived of His Forgiveness",

In short, if a person dies while still ascribing partners to Allah (Exalted be He), they will abide in Hell eternally forever by the Ijma' of the people of knowledge, such as those who worship idols, trees, stars, the sun, the moon, the prophets, the dead people or the so­called Awliya' (pious servants) or those who call upon them for help and ask them for support while near or away from their graves, saying for example, \"O Master so­and­so, Maddad (give us strength)!\" or \"O our Master Al­Badawy! Help us!\" or \"O our Master 'Abdul­Qadir or our Master, the Messenger of Allah, Maddad (give us strength), support us!\" or \"O our Master Al­Husayn, or O Fatimah or O Zaynab!\" and other people who are called upon instead of Allah by those who commit Shirk. Indeed, all these acts are classified as major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam) and if a person dies persisting in them, they will be among the dwellers of Hell. May Allah protect us from this! Also, such a person will abide there forever. As for the second and third crimes, namely killing and Zina, they are less serious than Shirk, but they are the gravest sins following Shirk as long as the person who commits them does not consider them to be Halal (lawful), but is aware that they are Haram (forbidden), yet is driven by anger, desire or other impulses to commit murder; or driven by desire and incitement of Satan to commit Zina, while they know that killing without a just cause is prohibited and that Zina is also prohibited. Accordingly, those who fall in these two major crimes are threatened with the punishment stated in the aforementioned Ayah, unless Allah (Exalted be He) forgives them or accepts their sincere Tawbah before their death. Indeed, due to the grossness of these two crimes and the corruption that results from them, Allah (Exalted be He) mentions them side by side with the crime of Shirk in this Ayah.

It is evident that the Hadith means that Muslims should revive and manifest a deserted act of Sunnah. For example, if one of the scholars visits a country where the Qur'an is being taught but the Sunnah is not, he should gather people to teach them the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah or bring teachers to do so on his behalf to revive this act of Sunnah. If another one is in a country where its people shave or cut the beards. He should advise them to let the beards grow aiming at reviving this act of Sunnah. His reward will be equivalent to that of those who follow him in this guidance. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Trim closely the moustache and let the beard grow ­ do the opposite of the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).\" (Agreed upon its authenticity by Al­Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar [may Allah be pleased with them])When this scholar lets his beard grow, calls people to do so, and they follow him, he then revives a stressed Sunnah which should not be abandoned according to the said Hadith and the other narrations to that effect. Thus, his reward is equal to those who follow him.",

One must also feel regret with a firm determination never to do this thing again. In addition, one has to give back the rights to the parties wronged or ask for their forgiveness, such as saying, \"My brother, forgive me,\" or \"Pardon me,\" or making similar apologies. This is based upon the Hadith mentioned by the questioner and many other Hadiths and Ayahs (Qur'anic verses). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Anyone who has wronged his brother in his honour or anything, let him ask his forgiveness for it today before the time (i.e., the Day of Resurrection) when there will be no Dinar or a Dirham (to compensate for the wrong deed). If he has any righteous deeds, it will be taken from them in proportion to the wrong he did; and if he has not any righteous deeds, some of the bad deeds of his companion will be taken and burdened on him.\" (Related by Al­Bukhari in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])Believers must be keen to absolve themselves from accountability for rights violated by giving them back to their owners or by asking for their pardon. If they violated someone's honor, they should ask forgiveness for it, if they can. But if they cannot or are afraid of the negative consequences, and that telling the person may cause greater harm, they should ask Allah's Forgiveness for that person, supplicate to Allah for them, and mention their merits instead of the evils they mentioned about them in the past. They should wash away the former bad deed by later good deeds by mentioning the good things they know about them and spreading their merits in place of the demerits they formerly mentioned, and by asking Allah's Forgiveness and supplicating for them. In this way, they can end this problem.",

This applies only to Muslims, because when a Muslim does these good deeds seeking the Good Pleasure of Allah, this can be a means to salvation from Hellfire. There are many means for gaining salvation from Hellfire and admittance to Jannah, so believers should try to attain as much of them as they can. Islam itself is the only source and the basic cause for gaining admittance to Jannah and salvation from Hellfire. There are actions which, if the Muslim does them, he will enter Jannah and be saved from Hell, among them is taking care of daughters or sisters, for they will be a protection for him against Hellfire: \"Whoever suffers the death of three children who have not yet reached puberty, they will be a protection for him against Hellfire. They said, \"O Messenger of Allah, what about two?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"And two.\" But they did not ask him about one child. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Allah (may He be Exalted) says: My believing servant shall have no other reward from Me if I take his bosom companion from the people of this world, then he patiently bears it with the hope of reward, except Paradise.\" Thus, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies that a believing servant shall have no less a reward from Him than Jannah, if when He takes the one whom he loves of the people of this world, the bereaved bears it patiently, hopeful of reward. A little children of ours who dies before puberty is included in this Hadith. Thus, when a child dies and his father or mother or both endure it patiently, hopeful of reward, they will attain Jannah. This is a great bounty from Allah. The same applies to husbands, wives, and all other relatives and friends, if they are patient and hope for reward, then they are included in this Hadith, so long as they take care to avoid anything which may prevent that, such as dying while still persisting in a major sin.

It is reported in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, and from (one) Friday Prayer to (the next) Friday Prayer, and from Ramadan to Ramadan, are expiations for whatever (sins committed) between them, provided that major sins are not committed.\" According to another narration: \"...provided that major sins are avoided.\" (Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])So, it indicates that the great acts of 'Ibadah (worship) erase sins on condition that the grievous sins are avoided. This Hadith is in conformity with the previous Ayah. One time when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was performing Wudu' (ablution), he mentioned that whoever performs Wudu' perfectly, his previous sins shall be forgiven as long as one avoids Al-Maqtalah (i.e. grievous sins). So, a believer must strive to do good, compete in righteous acts, and avoid sins, especially, the grievous ones because their danger is great unless Allah forgives them as long as they are not one of the acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Allah (Exalted be He) says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills",

Thus, if a Muslim visits another Muslim or non-Muslim for the purpose of calling them to Allah, teaching them and guiding them to goodness without seeking worldly gain or taking the Commands of Allah lightly, this is a good act. It is good for a Muslim woman to visit her sister in Islam and advise her to avoid Tabarruj (women dressed immodestly in violation of the Islamic dress code), unveiling the face or taking lightly what Allah prohibits. Similarly, it is good to visit her Christian or non-Christian female neighbor, such as a Buddhist woman or the like, to advise, teach, or instruct her. Actually, this comes under the heading of the Prophet's words: \"Religion is sincerity (well-wishing). Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.\" If she responds positively, all praise is to Allah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not serve any useful purpose. Visiting for the purpose of gaining worldly benefits, playing, exchanging idle talks, eating or the like is not permissible to be made to non-Muslims, whether they are Christians or others. Such visits may corrupt one's religious commitment or morals, because the Kafirs (disbelievers) are enemies to us and we do not feel love towards them [as a reaction for their Shirk, disbelief, rejection of truth, enmity, sinning, transgression against Allah, etc. Ed]. Thus, we should not take them as protectors or confidants. However, visits are required when they are made for the purpose of calling to Allah, urging to do goodness, and warning against evil. In Surah (Qur'anic chapter) Al-Mumtahinah, Allah (may He be Praised) says: Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: \"Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone\"",
