One of these means is to revise their previously-studied lessons with colleagues in order to memorize them by heart and use them to strengthen their `Aqidah (faith), manners, and efforts. Moreover, I recommend all young people to use their free time in reciting the Qur'an attentively and memorizing what they can of its Ayahs (Qur'anic verses), because the Qur'an is the source of happiness for all Muslims and the spring gushing forth goodness and guidance. Allah (Glorified be He) revealed the Qur'an as a clarification of all things and as a guide, mercy, and glad tidings to Muslims. Even more, He (Glorified be He) has made it a guide to that which is most just and right and has urged His Servants to recite it and contemplate its meanings. Allah states: Do they not then think deeply in the Qur'ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)? Allah (Exalted be He) also states: (This is) a Book (the Qur'ân) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.
