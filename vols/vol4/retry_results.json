Tell someone to cut off the head of the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to tear up the curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on; and tell someone to put the dog outside.' The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did that. The dog belonged to Al-Hasan or Al-Husayn and was under their couch. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that it would be taken outside the house. This is the wording of Abu Dawud and a similar wording was reported by Al-Tirmidhy. The following is the wording of Al-Nasa'y: Jibril asked the Prophet's permission to enter his house whereupon the Prophet said, \"Get in,\" but Jibril replied, \"How could I enter your house and there is a curtain on which there are suras? Either you cut off their heads or make it (the curtain) into a cushion spread out so that the people may tread on. We, angels, do not enter a house in which there are suras.\"",

This is because their lawfulness is doubtful due to the possibility that the Prophet (peace be upon him) might have approved of `Aishah's possession of dolls before the order to efface suras was revealed. In such a case, the permission would be considered Mansukh by the Hadith including the order to efface suras except those whose heads are cut off or those which are degraded, as stated by Al­Bayhaqy, Ibn Al­Jawzy, and Ibn Battal. Another possibility is that this permission could be a special exception to the general prohibition, as the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) have stated, for the sake of training girls to be mothers and because playing with dolls entails a kind of disrespect. As this possibilities loom and the doubt is there, it is safer to avoid the possession of toys and dolls. In fact, it is better to train girls using non­corporeal toys in order to be safe from the questionable matter regarding the possession of corporeal dolls. In this way, you will be acting according to the following Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. Also, it is narrated on the authority of Al­Nu`man ibn Bashir ­ as related in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith: What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are doubtful matters which many people do not know. Thus, whoever guards against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and whoever indulges in doubtful matters, indulges, in fact, in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures their animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it.
