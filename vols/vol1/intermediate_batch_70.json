As for the rest of the planets which are the stable ones, they are in an eighth orbit called (the orbit of the stable stars) which some scholars say that it is the Chair, and the ninth planet is Al­ Atlas or, for them, Al­Athir whose rotation is opposite to the rotation of all other orbits, since its rotation is the starter of all other rotations and it rotates from the west to the east, while all other orbits rotate from the east to the west and it is that which rotates all planets. Nevertheless, the rotating planets have opposite rotation to their orbits, since they rotate from the west to the east and each planet rotates within its orbit at a fixed time. The Moon makes complete rotation within its orbit once a month, the Sun once a year, Saturn once every thirty years due to the distance of the orbit, although the speed of rotation of all planets is suitable for the orbit.

On the other hand, it is not allowed to say that this it is impossible for this to happen unless there is legal evidence stating this impossibility. Furthermore, it is not allowed to believe those who claim that they went to the Moon or to other planets unless there is scientific evidence proving their truthfulness. Undoubtedly, people are different in their information about the space and astronauts. Thus, whoever receives information through observatories or through other means and becomes satisfied with this information, which proves to them the correctness of what has been claimed by the American astronauts or by other than them that they ascended to the Moon, then he is excused in believing such information. On the other hand, whoever does not obtain such information which proves that, then they are obligated to stop at this point and to verify the entire case until it is confirmed to them what makes them believe or disbelieve that, following the above­mentioned proofs.",

It is to be noted that Ibn Jarir preferred this saying and said that the following verse proves his choice. The second opinion is that this verse refers to the inability of the Jinn and Mankind to escape death, because they do not have authority that enables them to escape death and they do not have authority to escape the horrors of the Day of Resurrection.
