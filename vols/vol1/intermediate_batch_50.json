Besides, there are some other narrations regarding the virtue of this night reported from the righteous predecessors of the people of Al­Sham (the Levant) and others. What the majority of Muslim scholars agreed upon is that the celebration of this Mid­Sha'ban night is Bid'ah and that the Hadiths reported regarding the virtue of this night are all weak Hadiths and some of them are fabricated Hadiths. From those who drew the attention to the weakness and fabrication of these Hadiths is Al­Hafiz ibn Rajab in his book entitled: (Lata'if Al­Ma'arif) and people other than him. It is to be noted that the weak Hadiths can be applied only in the types of worship, the origin of which have been established by sound and authentic evidence.

In another narration he recommended staying up late for Prayer during those nights following the act of `Abdul­Rahman ibn Yazid ibn Al­Aswad who was one of the Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), in that. By the same token, there is no sound and authentic narration reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Companions regarding staying up late for Prayer during the Mid­Sha'ban night.

Thus, if the Mid­Sha'ban night, the night of the first Friday of Rajab or the night of Isra' (Night Journey) and Mi`raj (Ascension to Heaven) were singled out with a certain type of worship, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would guide the Ummah to it or would do it himself and if something like this had happened, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) would have transmitted it to the Ummah and would not conceal it from the following generations since they were the best people and the best in giving advice after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon all of them) and may Allah be pleased with the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and may they be pleased by Allah.",

The three things mentioned above cannot even be realized through writing the Qur'an, so how could they be realized by writing this false will? Rather, this wicked person wants to confuse people and attract them to this invalid will, so they will write it and adhere to its claimed merit and leave the lawful ways legislated by Allah for His Servants to gain wealth, repay debts, and have sins forgiven. We seek refuge with Allah from all the ways leading to humiliation, and following desires and Satan.",
