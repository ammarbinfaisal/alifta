These sects completely deny Allah's Perfect Attributes. They give Him attributes of inanimate beings. Far is He above what they ascribe to Him! Other sects such as Al­Asha`irah (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic) deny some of the Attributes while confirming others, thus contradicting clear logical as well as textual evidence. However, Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­ Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) confirmed all the Names and Attributes that Allah has confirmed for Himself in the Qur'an or through His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). They set Him far above His creation, as there is no one who resembles Him in anything. They refer to all proofs in the Qur'an and the Sunnah without twisting the meaning thereof in the least. In this way, they avoided confusion into which others have fallen. This belief is the way to salvation and bliss in this world and in the Hereafter. It is the Straight Path followed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and the leaders of this Ummah (Nation). The condition of the present­day Muslims will not be rectified except by following the same path of the predecessors who adhered to the Qur'an and the Sunnah of His Messenger and shunned all that contradict them.",

This narrator, Mahmud, was a young Sahaby (Companion of the Prophet) who did not hear any Hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him). But the Hadith Mursal narrated by the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) are Sahih (authentic) and used as evidence by the scholars and some scholars reported this as a consensus.",

Every believer need to search their deeds and oblige themselves to adhere to Al­Haqq (the Truth) and be influenced by those who practice what Islam preaches.

Consequently, they firmly stand upon the true path and its pursuit becomes a characteristic inherent in them; after that they can never be affected by those who want to hinder them from that path or make them doubtful about it. It is very important for a Muslim to pay careful attention to this matter, call themselves to account for their deeds and have good knowledge about it in order not to be confused or get misled by those who spread doubtful matters.",

If they do not mean by this act to draw themselves closer to their dwellers; rather they mean to draw closer to Allah Alone, in such a case the doer is considered a Mubtadi' (one who introduces innovations in religion), not a Kafir (disbeliever). Circumambulating around graves is a condemned Bid'ah (innovation in religion) just like offering Salah (Prayer) at the graves. All such acts are means leading to Kufr. In most cases, people who worship at graves aim at drawing closer to their dwellers by circumambulating around them. They sacrifice animals and vow for their sake in order to draw closer to them.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked the Permission of his Lord to seek forgiveness for his mother, but he (peace be upon him) was not permitted to ask forgiveness for her; because she died while embracing the religion of Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance) and so was his father.

Such principle of inheritance found what had justified it when man was responsible for woman, who was in a social level that did not allow the equality between her and man, as the girl was buried alive and despised, but nowadays, she is working and she might be in charge of the affairs of her little brothers and sisters. For example, my wife was the one in charge of the affairs of her brother and she stayed up late to take care of him and faced all types of agricultural hardships to provide him with necessary means of education. She was very careful to achieve the hope of her father who wanted his son to be a lawyer. Is it, then, reasonable that such sister inherits half of what the brother inherits in such case? Therefore, we need to work out our discretion to analyze this situation and hasten the development of the Islamic Law to be in accordance with the developments of the society.

People are generally aware that a person may hate another and think ill of him, but does not revile him, and may add revilement to this. But even if the revilement is the exact thought in mind, still not all that can be thought can be said, and not all that can be said secretly can be said openly, and the same word can in one situation be a blasphemy and in another not a blasphemy.

A deep look at the past and present history of this Ummah (nation) and the changes it has experienced indicates our statement and the meaning of the two aforesaid Ayahs will be clearer. The solid evidence of that is exemplified in the early Muslim generations who acquired power and were thus victorious over their enemies, because they adhered to Allah's Shari`ah (Islamic Law), co­operated in righteousness and piety, had an honest intention in considering the beneficial means and fought the enemies. When they changed that, Allah (Exalted be He) changed their state. This lesson could be derived from the battles of Badr and Uhud which bear witness to what we mentioned. When the Muslims were true to their covenant with their Prophet (peace be upon him) in fighting the Kuffar (disbelievers) on the Battle of Badr, Allah (May He be Exalted) made them victorious over their enemies even though they were the less in number and weapons. Likewise, when the archers left their positions on the hills on the Battle of Uhud and disobeyed the commands of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who warned them not to leave their positions, the Muslims incurred great loss and lost the battle with a total loss of seventy Muslim killed and many more wounded.

They claim that giving a woman half of a man's share is a mistake and should be amended and that in modern life a woman should receive an equal share, on the grounds that she is now working in the same fields of men, such as education, industry, agriculture, and police. Therefore, it is not logical to give preference to men over women. They claim that this ruling can be applied only when a man has authority over women and when a woman's social status did not allow her to be equal to man and when she used to be buried alive. Today, women take part in the workforce with men. They claim that we should practice Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) with regard to this issue and should develop the judiciary rulings according to the needs of the society. They also claim that some authorities restricted polygamy through practicing Ijtihad in the tacit meaning of the relevant Ayah. They believe that rulers should develop legislation to conform with their peoples' development and their concept of justice and life. This article was published by Al­Sabah newspaper but Al­Shihab newspaper did not point to it. It includes various forms of Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance, such as doubting Allah's rulings and urging rulers to alter the Shari`ah rulings according to their desires, judgment, people, and living standards. Undoubtedly, this is falsehood and an imitation of the Jews and the Christians, who changed the laws that were revealed to their prophets and, instead, invented new laws and ascribed them to Allah (Glorified be He).

According to the conclusive evidence of the Qur'an, Sunnah, and Ijma` (consensus of scholars), Allah (Glorified be He) knows what was, is, and will be. He knows the past, the present, and the future of His servants. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, It is Allâh Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge. and, He is Allâh, beside Whom Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the All­Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah (Glorified be He) is All­Wise, All­Knower, the Most Merciful and the Most Gracious. He does not do injustice or oppress anyone. He is All­Wise and All­Knower of the affairs of His servants and the Most Kind to them. Allah has legislated the rulings that maintain goodness and mercy to people and establish justice among them, including the rulings of inheritance and the like. He (Glorified be He) is the Most Just of the judges and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. He is the All­Knower of the affairs of His servants and what adjusts them in the end of time. He (Glorified be He) is the One Who sent down legislation that is beneficial to His servants. Whoever claims otherwise is in fact doubting Allah's Wisdom and Knowledge. If Allah wants the rulers or the scholars to amend His rulings, He would have clarified this to His servants in the Qur'an or through His Messenger (peace be upon him). Nothing as such has happened. Therefore, His rulings should be applied till the Day of Resurrection. In His Book, Allah has clarified that it is obligatory to follow, abide by, and rule people in accordance with the rulings that He has sent down. Allah warns people against breaching these rulings.

And whoever disobeys Allâh and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error. After this clear manifestation and severe warning, it is not for any ruler or scholar to violate the rulings that Allah has sent down regarding the rules of inheritance or others. Similarly, it is not for anyone to call the rulers to change the Divine rulings to conform with the societies' development. This is Kufr (disbelief), misguidance, and doubting the rulings of Allah. It is also a deviation from Shari`ah. Indeed, this is an abominable statement and falsehood. Whoever considers it permissible, approves of and advocates it, is a non­Muslim. Muslim scholars unanimously agreed that Ijtihad should be practiced with regard to subsidiary matters that have no textual evidence. On the other hand, `Aqidah (creed) and the rulings that have textual evidence from the Qur'an and the authentic Sunnah are not a debatable matter. It is Wajib (obligatory) upon all to act in conformity with the textual evidence and abandon anything that contradicts it.

Allah (Glorified be He) accepts the repentance and pardons mistakes of those who ask for His forgiveness, if they are sincere in repentance to Him.

What is meant here is the Attributes which Allah likes His Servants to acquire, such as knowledge, power, mercy, patience, generosity, forgiveness and so on. He (Glorified be He) is Knowledgeable and He likes knowledgeable people; He is Powerful and He likes powerful people more than weak ones; He is Generous and He likes generous people; He is Merciful and He likes merciful people; He is Forgiving and He likes forgiving people, etc. However, Allah's Attributes are incomparable, greater and more perfect than those acquired by people, as there is nothing like Him (Glorified be He) in His Attributes and Action, just like there is nothing like Him in His Entity.

Therefore, anyone who calls upon the dead prophets or others, or idols, trees, stones, or any other creatures, or appeals to any of them for support, or tries to get close to them by offering sacrifices, making vows, prays or prostrates to them, has taken them as their lords instead of Allah and made them equal to Him (Exalted be He). This is certainly a breach of this principle; it negates the meaning of there is no deity but Allah. Also, anyone who introduces a Bid'ah (innovation in religion) that Allah has not permitted, has not realized the meaning of the Shahadah that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust. Such are the deeds done by those who died as Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and those who practice Bid'ah. On the Day of Resurrection these deeds will be like scattered dust, as they are not in accordance with Allah's Purified Law. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Anyone who introduces something in this matter of ours (the religion) that is not from it, will have it rejected.\" (Agreed upon by Al­Bukhari and Muslim) This writer has addressed her invocation for help and support to the Messenger (peace be upon him) and turned away from Allah, the Lord of the worlds, in Whose Hand is support, harm and benefit.

There are two narrations reported from Al­Awza'iy regarding the recommendation to stay up late for prayer during the Mid­Sha'ban night relying on the two narrations reported from Imam Ahmad regarding staying up late for Prayer during the two nights of 'Eid. In one narration, he did not recommend staying up late in congregational prayer during the two nights of 'Eid because it was not reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) or from his Companions that they did that. In another narration he recommended staying up late for Prayer during those nights following the act of `Abdul­Rahman ibn Yazid ibn Al­Aswad who was one of the Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), in that. By the same token, there is no sound and authentic narration reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Companions regarding staying up late for Prayer during the Mid­Sha'ban night.

This liar says that the shaykh saw the Prophet (may peace be upon him) in his sleep and that he gave him this will. However, in this latest will that we have just mentioned to you, our dear readers, the fabricator claims that the shaykh saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he was preparing to sleep, so this means that he saw him (peace be upon him) while he was awake! The fabricator claims many things in this will, which are some of the most obvious lies, and most manifest fabrications, to which I will soon draw your attention in my remarks, In sha'a­Allah (if Allah wills). I have actually clarified these matters over the last few years and alerted people to these falsehoods. However, when I read the latest publication, I hesitated to write about it because of its patent falsehood. Also, I did not think that it would be circulated by those who had the least insight or sound Fitrah (natural disposition), but many brothers told me that it had been sent to many people and they were discussing it and believing it. Therefore, I felt it incumbent upon people like me to write about it, to explain the falsity and assail this fabrication that has been attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), so no one will be deceived by it.

We witness before Allah that it is a lie and its fabricator is a liar who wants to legislate that which Allah has not permitted and introduce new practices into the Din that are not from it. Allah perfected the Din and completed it for this Ummah (nation based on one creed) fourteen centuries before this lie. So, dear readers and fellow Muslims, beware of believing these lies and others like it and circulating them among you, as the truth has a clear and unmistaken light for its seekers, so ask for the truth with evidence and ask the scholars about doubtful matters. You should not be deceived by the vows of liars, as the cursed Satan once swore to your ancestors, Adam and Hawa' (Eve), that he was an advisor, although he is the worst betrayer and wickedest of all liars, as Allah narratesin Surah Al­ A'raf,the words he said,",

Also, there is cauterization which is regarded as a reprehensible means of cure. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: If there is any healing in your medicines, then it is in cupping, a gulp of honey or branding with fire (cauterization) that suits the ailment, but I don't like to be branded with fire (cauterized). In another wording: I forbid my nation to use cauterization. Thus, scholars have derived from this Prophetic Hadith that cauterization is reprehensible, but it can be used when necessary. Moreover, cauterization should be the last resort for medical treatment when it is difficult to find other means of treatment. The third type of cure methods are medications through forbidden means such as wine, flesh of wild animals and other forbidden kinds of food",

It is not permissible for a Muslim to have such forbidden things as medicines even some people claim that such things contain a benefit and even if the one having them has full belief that Allah is the Curer and they are no more than means of cure. This is because there are many pieces of evidence on the prohibition of treatment with ritually impure substances and unlawful medication even if they have some benefits, i.e. when harm is more evident than benefit. Moreover, not all that is useful is lawful. There are two prerequisites for anything to be lawful for use. First, there should be no legal evidence of prohibition. Second, harm resulting from it should not be more than its benefit. If its harm is more, it is not permissible for a person to use it even if there is no evidence of prohibition. This is because Shari`ah (Islamic Law) prohibits anything whose harm is more than its benefit, such as alcohol. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: O Allah's servants! Treat yourselves medically, but use nothing unlawful In another narration: Allah did not make the cure of you in what He prohibited for you. Also, it was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: A man asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about wine being used as medicine. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"No it is a disease.\" It can be derived from what has been mentioned that the criterion of lawfulness or prohibition has nothing to do with a person's belief, but rather the legal evidence. It happens that someone believes that Allah is the Only Curer, but takes prohibited medications like disbelievers who worship gods other than Allah (Exalted be He) and claim that such gods bring them nearer to Allah and intercede with Him for them, even though they believe that such gods do not cure them, bring their absent people back, or defend them. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And they worship besides Allâh things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with Allâh.\" Allah (Glorified be He) also says: So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh's sake only. Surely the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allâh only. And those who take Auliyâ' (protectors, helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say): \"We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.\" Verily Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever. There are a lot of pieces of evidence on this point. Someone may have some lawful medications, such as Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), drugs, injections, etc.",

This is what Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah bestow His mercy upon him) believed in, accepted as his religion and invited others to. Whoever attributes something different from that to him, then he lies and invents a manifest sin and says something about which he has no knowledge. So, Allah (Exalted be He) will punish him with the punishment He threatened the like of him from those who invent sins. Moreover, he (may Allah bestow His mercy upon him) produced useful reports, unique researches and great compilations with regard to sincerity, monotheism, bearing witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and what has been proved by the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the consensus of opinion including the negation of the right of worship and godhood for other than Allah and confirming them to Allah (Exalted be He) in a perfect way that contradicts minor and major polytheism. Whoever is acquainted with his writings and what was transmitted from him or known and become widespread from his Da'wah (call to Islam) and affairs, and what has been practiced by his notable companions and students, will find that the Shaykh followed the practice of the righteous predecessors and the leaders of religion and guidance of sincere worship to Allah, the One and Only, and avoided innovations in religion and superstitions. Saudi Arabia is based on this principle and its scholars, praise be to Allah, follow that way. The government of Saudi Arabia is persistent against innovations in religion and superstitions that have been inserted into the religion of Islam that exceed the proper limits prohibited by the Messenger (peace be upon him). It is noted that scholars and Muslims in Saudi Arabia as well as their rulers have a great deal of respect for every Muslim and harbor all kinds of loyalty, love and appreciation regardless of their nationality. They only deny what the followers of deviated beliefs do including innovations in religion and superstitions and innovated celebrations. They deny the initiation of such festivals and celebrating them as long as Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) did not allow them and prohibited such celebrations. This is because they are invented issues in religion and every invented issue in religion is an innovation and Muslims are commanded not to follow them and are prohibited to innovate, because of the perfection of the religion of Islam and because of what Allah (Exalted be He)",

As for the rest of the planets which are the stable ones, they are in an eighth orbit called (the orbit of the stable stars) which some scholars say that it is the Chair, and the ninth planet is Al­ Atlas or, for them, Al­Athir whose rotation is opposite to the rotation of all other orbits, since its rotation is the starter of all other rotations and it rotates from the west to the east, while all other orbits rotate from the east to the west and it is that which rotates all planets. Nevertheless, the rotating planets have opposite rotation to their orbits, since they rotate from the west to the east and each planet rotates within its orbit at a fixed time. The Moon makes complete rotation within its orbit once a month, the Sun once a year, Saturn once every thirty years due to the distance of the orbit, although the speed of rotation of all planets is suitable for the orbit.

There is also another argument and this is their saying that if Arabs hold fast to Islam and gather around its banner, the enemies of Islam will resent them, will not give them their rights and will await for them turns of misfortune, out of fear that they will wage Islamic wars against them with which they will retain their past glory, and this harms us and wastes our rights and interests which we have with our enemies and enrage them against us.",

Moreover, it is the means of instilling awe in the hearts of the enemies from the disbelievers so that they will be frightened of Muslims and will give them their complete rights without deficiency as happened to their believing ancestors. There were many Jews and Christians living among them, but they had not taken them as allies and had not sought help from them; rather, they had taken Allah as their Ally and Supporter and sought help from Him, and therefore, He protected them, supported them, and gave them victory over their enemies. The Qur'an and the Sunnah testify to this fact, and the Islamic history states this clearly. Moreover, this fact is known by Muslim and Kafirs (non­Muslims). It is reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) went out on the day of Badr to encounter the Mushriks and in Madinah there were Jews, but he did not seek help from them, although Muslims were a minority at that time, not a majority and they were in an urgent need for helpers and supporters, however, the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) and Muslims did not seek help from the Jews.",

Such a heart is not formed by itself, and it is impossible for it to be formed amidst trends of doubts and ignorance which are intentionally directed against it in order to halt and deter it. Indeed, such a heart is formed by the means of organized spiritual nutrition presented in educational programs, in the admonishments at the Masjids and within an environment which is filled with certain concepts which help in respect to virtue and the propagation of it. We are in dire need of forming such consciences in our young offspring who become devoid of them and within the dense casts which have become accustomed to playing and disrespecting all values. I am really astonished, why do we buy a very expensive machine and put in charge of it a worker who does not fear Allah? It will quickly be destroyed at his hands, or at least, it best it will be less productive if it remains unbroken. If we spend a minimum amount of money to instill God consciousness in the heart of this worker, we will achieve a lot. Then do officials spend this minimum amount of money, even if they consider it as the maintenance cost of this machine that has been purchased?",

How can a comparison be drawn between nationalism, where Hellfire will be the end of whoever dies advocating it, and the faith Islam, where Paradise will be the end of whoever dies adhering to it?",

It is known that doctors examine diseases and do their best to find a suitable cure for each disease, beginning with the most fatal of such diseases. This was the way of the best of all creatures, Muhammad (peace be upon him) who, when he was sent by Allah to mankind, forbade people to commit the worst of all sins, Shirk (associating others in worship along with Allah). That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) kept on warning people against Shirk and calling them to Tawhid (monotheism) for ten years after which he began to enjoin people to perform Salah (Prayer) and do other obligatory acts of worship. Similarly, preachers should follow his guidance by tackling the most important issues first and then the lesser ones. However, if the society is a Muslim one, a preacher can discuss both important and ordinary issues alike, and had actually better do so as much as he can. This is because a preacher has to do his best to reform the Muslim society and remove any misconceptions relating to Islamic `Aqidah (Creed) and purify the Muslim nation from any corrupt manner that may harm the Muslim society and weaken its faith. A preacher can begin his sermons by tackling ordinary issues if he has no chance to discuss the most important issues. He can prioritize some issues and delay some others in case he sees that it is better to begin with important issues and is afraid that being occupied with all issues may",

Our Prophet (peace be upon him) will get a reward equivalent to those who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection because he (peace be upon him) conveyed the Message of Islam to them and guided them to the right path. Similarly, the Prophets (peace be upon them) will be given a reward equivalent to those who followed them in righteousness.

Therefore, they felt unmistaken to overtake unrightfully the properties of people. They also did not feel any pricking of conscience for committing genocide and taking over wealth. They did not consider worthwhile the means of lawful earning that Allah has sanctioned, i.e. acquiring money through exploiting one's physical and mental abilities as well as all other tools granted to one by Allah. On the other hand, Islam's economic system protects private property, provides for acquisition of money by lawful means and prohibits unlawful means or acquiring money by injustice, cheating, usury and oppression. Rather, it respects and recognizes the inviolability of individual and public ownership. Islam is thus in a medium position between the two unjust economic systems, in that it declares that acquisition of money is lawful and encourages people to acquire it but in a judicious way, which may not hinder a person from his obligations to Allah and His Prophet (peace be upon him).",

Let us briefly describe the prevailing conditions in Najd before the call of the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) and about the reasons for it. The people of Najd before the call of the Shaykh lived in conditions that could not be approved of by any believer. Major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) spread widely, and the people worshiped domes, trees, rocks, caves, or those who claimed to be Awliya' (pious people) even if they were insane and mindless. Also, sorcery and soothsaying prevailed in Najd. The people used to ask practitioners of these evils for help and believed them. No one expressed any disapproval of these deeds except those whom Allah willed. The people were only preoccupied with fulfilling their worldly concerns and desires. Only a few people would observe optional night Prayers or support Islam. The same conditions prevailed in Al­Haramayn A l­Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques: the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet's Mosque in Madinah) and in Yemen where committing Shirk, building domes on the graves, and supplicating to the Awliya' and seeking their help became widespread. Thus, conditions were no different either in Yemen or in Najd where the people worshiped graves, caves, trees, and madmen. Supplicate to the jinn (creatures created from fire) became common in Najd. The people used to seek their help, offer them sacrificial animals, and place idols in their homes hoping for their help and fearing their harm. When the Shaykh saw that Shirk was dominating the people and that no one disapproved of it and was ready to call the people back to Allah, he decided to work singlehandedly and patiently in this field. He knew that nothing could be achieved without struggle, patience, and suffering. He, thus, exerted much effort in teaching, guiding, and instructing the people in Al­`Uyaynah. He wrote to many scholars requesting their support and struggled against acts of Shirk and superstitions. Many of the scholars of Najd, A l­Haramayn, Yemen and other places, responded and sent him letters of support. However, there were other scholars who disagreed with him, dispraised his call, and condemned and shunned him. Those who disagreed with him were of two types. One group consisted of the ignorant people,",

He also worked hard in studying the Prophet's biography and that of his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). He embarked on his studies until he deduced what helped him stand firm in his Da`wah. He was determined to spread his Da`wah among the people and wrote to rulers and scholars requesting their help, without fearing the consequences of his actions. Allah fulfilled his good hopes, granted him success in spreading the Da`wah, made him a supporter of Al­ Haqq, and favored him with followers and helpers. Consequently, true Islam prevailed and the word of Allah became uppermost. The Shaykh persevered in his Da`wah in Al­`Uyaynah and went on teaching and guiding the people to Islam. He struggled to remove any traces of Shirk. However, when he saw that his Da`wah was not sufficiently effective, he decided to physically remove Shirk as much as he could. He told Prince `Uthman ibn Ma`mar that the dome at the grave of Zayd had to be destroyed. Zayd ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) was the brother of `Umar ibn Al­Khattab, Amir Al­Mu'minin (Commander of the Believers) ­ may Allah be pleased with all of them.",

Similarly, other symbols of Shirk in addition to caves and trees, which people worshiped other than Allah, were all destroyed and people were warned against this evil practice. The Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) continued in his Da`wah through words and actions. One day, a woman came to him and confessed that she had committed Zina (adultery) several times. After realizing that she was sane, married, and had confessed without any external compulsion, he gave the order that she should be stoned as a punishment, as he was Judge of Al­`Uyaynah at the time.

He became concerned, because robbery, murder, and violating sanctities were common among Bedouins, except those whom Allah had guided.

Jihad began in 1158 A.H. with sword and speech, with argument and proof, then Da`wah continued along with Jihad by the sword. A caller to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), unless having power to sustain Al­Haqq, will fade away and lose supporters. It is well­known that weapons may be most effective in spreading Islam, suppressing opponents, sustaining Al­Haqq and refuting falsehood. Allah is the Most Truthful, Who (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:",

Their enemies, rivals and the fools besides some politicians wanted to subside this Da`wah, for fear of losing their offices and putting an end to their evil desires.

He (may Allah be merciful to him) followed in creedal matters the Madh­hab (School of Jurisprudence) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) while in subsidiary matters he followed the Madh­hab of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal Al­Shaibany (may Allah be merciful to him). This is clear in the books and Fatwas (legal opinions) of Muhammad ibn 'Abdul­Wahhab and in the books of his followers and offspring which are published. Imam Muhammad ibn 'Abdul­Wahhab appeared at a time when Islam was alienated, the Arabian Peninsula and other areas were engulfed in ignorance and worshiping idols was widespread.

It all began when His Highness, King `Abdul-`Aziz and the knowledgeable Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah be merciful with them and may He reward them good) discussed the idea of establishing an institution to carry out the duties of Da`wah (calling to Islam) and education according to the teachings of the Salaf, represented in the call of Imam Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah have mercy on him). Some academic institutions were established, then some colleges, and with passage of time, it expanded to be an Islamic university bearing the name of the Saudi State's first founder and supporter of the Islamic call, Imam Muhammad Ibn Sa`ud. Hence, the university has graduated a huge number of scholars who have played a great role in developing this country. In addition, the university teaches the compilations of Imam Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab, especially in the field of `Aqidah (creed), plus the books of previous famous Imams among the Salaf, such as Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Al-Qayyim, Al-Tahawy, Al-Hafizh Ibn Kathir and others, may Allah have mercy on them and reward them all for their efforts in striving in Allah's Cause, defending His way and showing people the Truth as Allah commands!",

This is because it involves cooperation in goodness, discussion of righteous deeds and a way of reaching the Truth. Many a time doubt is eliminated when scholars meet and discuss debatable issues. I am certain this gathering will have great effects on the Islamic World and will make Muslims unite on the Qur'an and Sunnah, abstain from committing Bid`ah and avoid dispersion which has weakened Muslims in the face of their enemies. There is no doubt that these prominent scholars coming from all over the Islamic world to discuss research and ideas, search for the best ways for Muslims to hold fast to the Qur'an and Sunnah and revive the Madh-hab of the Salaf will achieve positive results. Scholars will benefit all Muslims and call them to the just word without any fanaticism or immoderation in relation to people and ideas, since the Truth is clear. As Muslims, we should follow everything the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah used to do whether in our houses or in our countries. This is the core of the Salafiyyah call (those following the way of the righteous predecessors), initiated by Shaykh Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah have mercy on him). In addition, one of the most important positive outcomes of this gathering is collecting, editing and printing all the Shaykh's compilations and writings to be available to people. A valuable addition is printing and distributing an index of all the Shaykh's works.",

Allah (Exalted be He) also states, \"And verily, this (i.e. Allâh's Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - see V.2:2).\" He (Glorified be He) also states, And this is a blessed Book (the Qur'ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has promised us a decisive victory and successful outcome in return for this, as He is the Most Truthful, in His statement, and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). He (Glorified be He) states, But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious - See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) promises, Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). He (Glorified be He) also states, O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. There are many Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions and belief, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah's orders) they were changed, according to Allah's statement, Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh). But when Allâh wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.",

O dear reader, glorifying monuments is not by building memorials, inscriptions, and following in the footsteps of non­Muslims. The true celebration of these monuments is to follow in the footsteps of the people who did these brilliant exploits, good morality, and defended the Cause of Allah patiently and sincerely with words and actions. This is the way that the Salaf (righteous predecessors) used to glorify the good deeds of their predecessors. As for glorifying monuments by buildings, decorations and inscriptions, it is against the way of the Salaf, but it is rather the way of the Jews, the Christians and those who imitate them. Indeed, it is one of the gravest means to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and the worship of prophets",

The inventions of the non­Muslims, who reached the farthest point in this regard, have only pushed them to more Kufr (disbelief), atheism and corrupted morals. So people must not be fascinated by their knowledge and should not imitate them in their morals or costumes that contradict the teachings of Shari`ah. We should only take of their technologies that which is beneficial and urgently needed along with abiding by the teachings of our Shari`ah and being aware of anything that goes against it.

As for visiting the graves for seeking blessings, this is not permissible in Islam. Indeed, it is one of the acts of Jahiliyyah (Pre­Islamic time of ignorance) and a characteristic of grave worshipers. So, we must be aware of such acts and prohibit visitors from committing this. It is authentically reportedin Sahih (book of authentic Hadiths) Muslim on the authority of Buraydah (May Allah be pleased with him) that he said: Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) used to teach his Companions to recite the following when visiting the graves: 'Peace be upon you, the inhabitants of the graves of the believers and Muslims, and Allah willing we shall join you. We pray to Allah for well­being for ourselves and for you. In Al­Tirmidhy's book (Al­Jami`), it is related from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed by the graves of Madinah and said, \"May you be granted safety, O inmates of the graves. May Allah forgive you and us. You have preceded us, and we are to follow.'' This is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in visiting graves and showing the purpose of visiting them. As for seeking blessings from them, building over them, inscribing on them and heading to them for supplications, this is not an act of Sunnah. Rather, this is one of the traditions of the Jews, Christians, and the people of Jahiliyyah. We ask Allah to grant us and all Muslims safety.",

He added that if they had built the domes and Masjids to eternize the glorious actions of the dead, it would have been better...etc. This, however, combines both truth and falsehood. As for the truth, it is the writer's admittance that these acts of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) exist in some Islamic countries and his criticism of building domes (over graves) and Masjids as niches for worship and supplication to the dead. In fact, this is true and rampant in the neighboring countries ­ indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we will return. We ask Allah to protect Muslims from this and to grant them understanding of religion with which He sent Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in order to know that these innovations go against Shari`ah and lead to worshiping people other than Allah. Falsehood lies in the writer's differentiation between building domes and Masjids for worship and supplication, and making them memorials. This distinction has no basis in religion. Moreover, it contradicts the Divine texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, which provide for the impermissibility of building domes or Masjids for this reason. This is because building domes and Masjids over graves for worshiping, supplicating, and seeking help from the dead is an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as the people of Jahiliyyah did with Al­Lat, Al­`Uzza, Manah and other idols. Indeed, building such memorials is a means to taking the people of the graves as partners with Allah. The Qur'an and the Sunnah condemn, warn, and prohibit these means of polytheism. It is authentically reported inthe Two Sahih books of Hadith (Al­Bukhari and Muslim)from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: May Allah curse the Jews and Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their Prophets. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) was warning (Muslims) against what they had done.

In this article the writer calls for the glorification of Islamic monuments, lest they should be deserted and unknown to the people. The writer says that those who now visit the house once inhabited by Shakespeare in Britain and the house of Beethoven in Germany do not do so out of deification, but out of admiration to what the English poet and the German musician contributed to their countries. These trivial houses cannot be compared to the house of Prophet Muhammad, Dar Al­Arqam ibn Abu A l­Arqam, Thawr Cave, Hira' Cave, and the place where Al­Rudwan Bay`ah (pledge of allegiance) and Al­Hudaybiyyah treaty took place, he said. A few years ago, Egypt registered the history of the Sphinx and the glory of the Pharaohs, and tourists came from everywhere to listen to these trivial talks compared to the glory, history and great people of Islam in all aspects. The writer suggests that Muslims should glorify Islamic monuments that are of greater importance, such as the Hira' Cave and Thawr Cave, in addition to the previously mentioned English and German sites, and the glorification of the Egyptian Pharaonic monuments. The writer mentions that the Ministry of Hajj and Waqfs (Endowments) should maintain these monuments in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and benefit from them in the following ways:",

As nothing of this took place, it is not part of Islam, but rather a Bid`ah which the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) against. It was authentically reported from Amir Al­Mu'minin (Commander of the Believers) `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that he condemned pursuing the monuments of prophets and ordered that the tree under which the Bay`ah of Al­Hudaybiyyah took place be cut, when he learned that some people began going there. This was meant to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and eliminate the means leading to Shirk, Bid`ah and superstitions related to Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance). Below is some of what was mentioned by some scholars in this regard, so that you will be well­informed about this matter. Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Al­Walid Al­Tartushi said in his book 'Al­Hawadith wal­Bida`', a chapter entitled 'A Chapter on Forms of Bid`ah', p. 135, \"Al­Ma`rur ibn Suwayd said, 'When we went to perform Hajj with `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), we saw a Masjid (mosque) on the way, so people began offering Salah (Prayer) in it.' `Umar said, \"O, people! Those who were before you perished because of honoring such sites, until they took them as places of worship. If one arrives there at the time of Salah, one should offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.'\" On p. 141, he said on the authority of Muhammad ibn Waddah that `Umar ibn Al­Khattab ordered that the tree under which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given the Bay`ah be cut, because people began to visit it and `Umar feared that they might be misled. Ibn Waddah said, \"Malik and other scholars of Madinah hated going to the Masjids and Islamic monuments i n Madinah except Quba' and Uhud. Sufyan entered Jerusalem and offered Salah there, but he did not inquire about those monuments or offer Salah there; and others who imitated him did the same. Ibn Waddah then said, 'How many matters are now considered acceptable by many people that were once considered Munkar. People try to get closer to Allah through means that drive them further from Allah.'\" Shaykh­ul­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) said in his book 'Majmu` Al­Fatawa', Vol. 26, P. 133, \"As for climbing Mount Al­ Rahmah (at `Arafah)",

It is neither Mustahab to enter the Masjids at the place of Jamarat (stone pillars at which pebbles are thrown during Hajj) or offer Salah there. Circumambulation around them, the Stone, the room of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or anything other than the Ka`bah is a grave Bid`ah.\" He also said on p. 144 of the same section, \"As for visiting the Masjids that were built in Makkah other than Al­Masjid Al­Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), such as the one by the foot of A l­Safa, the one by the foot of Abu Qubays, and such Masjids that were built at the sites of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah, such as Masjid Al­Mawlid (the Prophet's birthday) and others, it is neither a Sunnah to visit these places, nor was it preferable by any of the Imams. It is only permissible to visit Al­Masjid A l­Haram in particular, and the sacred ritual places, such as `Arafah, Muzdalifah, Mina, Al­Safa and Al­Marwah. However, visiting the mountains and areas around Makkah other than `Arafah, Muzdalifah and Mina, such as Hira' Mountain, the mountain at Mina where it is claimed that there was the sacrifice dome and such places. it is not a Sunnah related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but rather a Bid`ah. The same applies to the Masjids built at the sites said to be monuments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not permit visiting any of these.\" In vol. 27, p. 134, of the same book, he also said, \"Some people might ask whether it is permissible to glorify a place where there is worn­out things and saffron as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was seen there. Glorification of such places and turning them into Masjids is an imitation of the People of the Book whom we are prohibited to imitate. It was authentically reported that `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) was traveling when he saw a group of people hurrying to a place. He asked, 'What is this?' People replied, 'It is a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.' He said, 'Do you want to turn the sites of your prophet into Masjids? If the time of Salah comes while a person is there, they can offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.' `Umar said this in the presence of a number of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah in many places while traveling, and the people would see him",

He said, 'Those who were before you perished because of this; they used to follow the traces of their prophets and turn them into places of `Ibadah. If the time of Salah comes while you are in such places, offer Salah there; otherwise you should leave, and do not go there intentionally.' `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) also uprooted the tree under which the Sahabah made the Bay`ah to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).\"",

Flags are lowered at half­mast and the State departments stop working. Undoubtedly, these acts go against Shari`ah and entail imitation of the enemies of Islam. Authentic Hadiths related from the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibit and warn people, except a wife, against mourning. The maximum period of mourning for a woman is four months and ten days, if the deceased is her husband, and three days for relatives and other persons. The other practices done during the mourning of any person, whether a king or a leader, are prohibited in Shari`ah. During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his son Ibrahim, his three daughters and others died, but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them. The leaders who joined the battle of Mu'tah, including Zayd Ibn Harithah, Ja`far ibn Abu Talib and 'Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with them) were killed during the Prophet's era and he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them. Furthermore, the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did not mourn the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the best of creation and prophets. Nor did they mourn Abu Bakr Al­ Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), the best of Sahabah and creation after the prophets. When `Umar, `Uthman and `Aly (may Allah be pleased with them), the best creation after the prophets and Abu Bakr Al­Siddiq, were killed, no one mourned them. The same was true with all the Sahabah and the Imams of Islam and guidance of Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and the next generation including Sa`id ibn Al­Musayyab, `Aly ibn Al­Husayn Zayn Al­`Abidin, his son Muhammad ibn `Aly, `Umar ibn `Abdul­`Aziz,",

No Muslim mourned those people. If this (mourning) were good, the Salaf would have done it. All goodness lies in following them and evil lies in opposing them. Therefore, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) affirmed that what the Salaf did concerning avoiding mourning any person except for a dead husband, is the right approach. What people show nowadays by mourning kings and leaders is unacceptable in Islam. These practices entail imitating the enemies of Islam and result in much harm, such as suspension of public services. Consequently, the Muslim authorities and rulers must abandon these acts of mourning and follow the conduct of the Salaf. Furthermore, the people of knowledge have to warn and inform Muslims about the ruling on these acts as they are obliged to advise people and cooperate in righteousness and piety. I, therefore, for the sake of Allah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and all Muslims, Imams and ordinary people, find it necessary to write this brief statement. I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant Muslim rulers and subjects success to do what pleases Him and to follow Shari`ah and warn against opposing it.

This is because such an act may lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and excessive veneration and overpraising of the prophets and pious people. The reality bears witness to the validity of what the Shari`ah asserts, evidence that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and unquestionable, decisive proof regarding the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down unto him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk.

May Allah's peace and blessings be upon you!",
