A deep look at the past and present history of this Ummah (nation) and the changes it has experienced indicates our statement and the meaning of the two aforesaid Ayahs will be clearer. The solid evidence of that is exemplified in the early Muslim generations who acquired power and were thus victorious over their enemies, because they adhered to Allah's Shari`ah (Islamic Law), co­operated in righteousness and piety, had an honest intention in considering the beneficial means and fought the enemies. When they changed that, Allah (Exalted be He) changed their state. This lesson could be derived from the battles of Badr and Uhud which bear witness to what we mentioned. When the Muslims were true to their covenant with their Prophet (peace be upon him) in fighting the Kuffar (disbelievers) on the Battle of Badr, Allah (May He be Exalted) made them victorious over their enemies even though they were the less in number and weapons. Likewise, when the archers left their positions on the hills on the Battle of Uhud and disobeyed the commands of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who warned them not to leave their positions, the Muslims incurred great loss and lost the battle with a total loss of seventy Muslim killed and many more wounded.

          "text": "According to the report of Al­Sabah newspaper, dated 20/3/1974 A.D, the fourth and fifth unacceptable points in this regard are: objection to giving a woman half of a man's share in inheritance and polygamy. They claim that giving a woman half of a man's share is a mistake and should be amended and that in modern life a woman should receive an equal share, on the grounds that she is now working in the same fields of men, such as education, industry, agriculture, and police. Therefore, it is not logical to give preference to men over women. They claim that this ruling can be applied only when a man has authority over women and when a woman's social status did not allow her to be equal to man and when she used to be buried alive. Today, women take part in the workforce with men. They claim that we should practice Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) with regard to this issue and should develop the judiciary rulings according to the needs of the society. They also claim that some authorities restricted polygamy through practicing Ijtihad in the tacit meaning of the relevant Ayah. They believe that rulers should develop legislation to conform with their peoples' development and their concept of justice and life. This article was published by Al­Sabah newspaper but Al­Shihab newspaper did not point to it. It includes various forms of Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance, such as doubting Allah's rulings and urging rulers to alter the Shari`ah rulings according to their desires, judgment, people, and living standards. Undoubtedly, this is falsehood and an imitation of the Jews and the Christians, who changed the laws that were revealed to their prophets and, instead, invented new laws and ascribed them to Allah (Glorified be He). According to the implicit meaning of the writer's article, Allah (Glorified be He) did not know about the future development of societies.",

According to the conclusive evidence of the Qur'an, Sunnah, and Ijma` (consensus of scholars), Allah (Glorified be He) knows what was, is, and will be. He knows the past, the present, and the future of His servants. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, It is Allâh Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge. and, He is Allâh, beside Whom Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the All­Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah (Glorified be He) is All­Wise, All­Knower, the Most Merciful and the Most Gracious. He does not do injustice or oppress anyone. He is All­Wise and All­Knower of the affairs of His servants and the Most Kind to them. Allah has legislated the rulings that maintain goodness and mercy to people and establish justice among them, including the rulings of inheritance and the like. He (Glorified be He) is the Most Just of the judges and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. He is the All­Knower of the affairs of His servants and what adjusts them in the end of time. He (Glorified be He) is the One Who sent down legislation that is beneficial to His servants. Whoever claims otherwise is in fact doubting Allah's Wisdom and Knowledge. If Allah wants the rulers or the scholars to amend His rulings, He would have clarified this to His servants in the Qur'an or through His Messenger (peace be upon him). Nothing as such has happened. Therefore, His rulings should be applied till the Day of Resurrection. In His Book, Allah has clarified that it is obligatory to follow, abide by, and rule people in accordance with the rulings that He has sent down. Allah warns people against breaching these rulings.

And whoever disobeys Allâh and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error. After this clear manifestation and severe warning, it is not for any ruler or scholar to violate the rulings that Allah has sent down regarding the rules of inheritance or others. Similarly, it is not for anyone to call the rulers to change the Divine rulings to conform with the societies' development. This is Kufr (disbelief), misguidance, and doubting the rulings of Allah. It is also a deviation from Shari`ah. Indeed, this is an abominable statement and falsehood. Whoever considers it permissible, approves of and advocates it, is a non­Muslim. Muslim scholars unanimously agreed that Ijtihad should be practiced with regard to subsidiary matters that have no textual evidence. On the other hand, `Aqidah (creed) and the rulings that have textual evidence from the Qur'an and the authentic Sunnah are not a debatable matter. It is Wajib (obligatory) upon all to act in conformity with the textual evidence and abandon anything that contradicts it. According to the scholars of the Four Madh­habs (Hanafy, Maliky, Shafi`y, and Hanbaly), it is Wajib to abide by the textual evidence. However,",
