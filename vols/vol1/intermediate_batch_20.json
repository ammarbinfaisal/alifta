In fact, the issue of belief in the Oneness of Allah (may He be exalted) and avoiding associates with Allah in His Divinity or worship is the most important issue. Allah (may He be exalted) sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) to call people to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and avoid Shirk. The Prophet (peace be upon him) spared no effort in the proclamation of the Message which Allah revealed to him. He (peace be upon him) carried it out at best and suffered severe harm for the Sake of Allah. The Prophet and his Sahabah (companions) (may Allah be pleased with them) showed patience in the proclamation of Da'wah (call to Allah). The result was that Allah removed from the Arabian Peninsula every symbol of Shirk. Thus, people entered into the Religion of Allah in multitudes. Moreover, the idols that surrounded the Ka'bah and were inside it were destroyed. The idols of Al­Lat, Al­'Uzza and Manat (names of the prominent idols that were worshipped by Arabs before Islam), and all other idols of the Arab tribes were devastated. Finally, the Word of Allah became superior to anything else and Islam spread in the Arabian Peninsula. Then Muslims undertook the duty of calling people to the Way of Allah and defended the Cause of Allah outside Al­Jazirah (Arabian Peninsula). Thus, Allah guided ­ through them ­ those predestined to eternal happiness.",

The most comprehensive definition is that stated by Shaykh Al­Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) who says: \"It is a comprehensive word comprising all deeds and words that Allah loves and is pleased with whether manifested or hidden.\" This means that 'Ibadah entails two things: total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) in all His Orders and Prohibitions in a Muslim's beliefs, words and deeds; and living according to the Shari'ah laid down by Allah. A Muslim should treat as lawful that which Allah has declared to be lawful and to treat as forbidden that which Allah has declared to be forbidden. They should submit in all their manners, actions and behaviors to Shari'ah resisting all personal desires and whims. This is applied both to individuals and societies and to both men and women. Anyone who submits to Allah in some aspects of their life and to creatures in other aspects is not a true worshipper of Allah.",
