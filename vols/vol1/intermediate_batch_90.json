First, they should begin with wisdom, which refers to the evident, convincing pieces of evidence that reveal the truth and refute falsehood. That is why some interpreters said that it is the Qur'an, as it is the greatest wisdom, and it perfectly reveals the truth. Some others said that it refers to the evidence in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). Anyhow, wisdom is a great word that means calling to Allah (Exalted be He) on the basis of knowledge, insight and solid, convincing evidence. It is a common word that is given for many concepts, including prophethood, knowledge, understanding religion, reason, and piety. It is similar to what Al­Shawkany (may Allah be merciful with him) said, \"Wisdom is the thing that protects from foolishness.\" This means that every word that protects you from foolishness, as well as anything that keeps you away from falsehood; and every clear, true statement is considered wisdom. The Qur'an is the most worthy of the designation 'wisdom', and next comes the authentic Sunnah.",

On the contrary, they enslaved and prosecuted people, disbelieved in Allah, denied all religions, and said life is materialistic. Therefore, they felt unmistaken to overtake unrightfully the properties of people. They also did not feel any pricking of conscience for committing genocide and taking over wealth. They did not consider worthwhile the means of lawful earning that Allah has sanctioned, i.e. acquiring money through exploiting one's physical and mental abilities as well as all other tools granted to one by Allah. On the other hand, Islam's economic system protects private property, provides for acquisition of money by lawful means and prohibits unlawful means or acquiring money by injustice, cheating, usury and oppression. Rather, it respects and recognizes the inviolability of individual and public ownership. Islam is thus in a medium position between the two unjust economic systems, in that it declares that acquisition of money is lawful and encourages people to acquire it but in a judicious way, which may not hinder a person from his obligations to Allah and His Prophet (peace be upon him).",

Consequently, he left Basra with the intention to head for the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine), but he was unable to go there, due to lack of finance. He, thus, left Basra to Al­Zubayr, then moved from Al­Zubayr to Al­Ahsa' where he met its scholars and discussed some of the principles of Islam. He finally moved to Huraymila' in the 1140s A.H.

Let us briefly describe the prevailing conditions in Najd before the call of the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) and about the reasons for it. The people of Najd before the call of the Shaykh lived in conditions that could not be approved of by any believer. Major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) spread widely, and the people worshiped domes, trees, rocks, caves, or those who claimed to be Awliya' (pious people) even if they were insane and mindless. Also, sorcery and soothsaying prevailed in Najd. The people used to ask practitioners of these evils for help and believed them. No one expressed any disapproval of these deeds except those whom Allah willed. The people were only preoccupied with fulfilling their worldly concerns and desires. Only a few people would observe optional night Prayers or support Islam. The same conditions prevailed in Al­Haramayn A l­Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques: the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet's Mosque in Madinah) and in Yemen where committing Shirk, building domes on the graves, and supplicating to the Awliya' and seeking their help became widespread. Thus, conditions were no different either in Yemen or in Najd where the people worshiped graves, caves, trees, and madmen. Supplicate to the jinn (creatures created from fire) became common in Najd. The people used to seek their help, offer them sacrificial animals, and place idols in their homes hoping for their help and fearing their harm. When the Shaykh saw that Shirk was dominating the people and that no one disapproved of it and was ready to call the people back to Allah, he decided to work singlehandedly and patiently in this field. He knew that nothing could be achieved without struggle, patience, and suffering. He, thus, exerted much effort in teaching, guiding, and instructing the people in Al­`Uyaynah. He wrote to many scholars requesting their support and struggled against acts of Shirk and superstitions. Many of the scholars of Najd, A l­Haramayn, Yemen and other places, responded and sent him letters of support. However, there were other scholars who disagreed with him, dispraised his call, and condemned and shunned him. Those who disagreed with him were of two types. One group consisted of the ignorant people,",

He sought the help of his Lord (Glorified and Exalted be He). He had already started to study the Qur'an, and was skilled in Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur'an) and deducing meanings from the Qur'an. He also worked hard in studying the Prophet's biography and that of his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). He embarked on his studies until he deduced what helped him stand firm in his Da`wah. He was determined to spread his Da`wah among the people and wrote to rulers and scholars requesting their help, without fearing the consequences of his actions. Allah fulfilled his good hopes, granted him success in spreading the Da`wah, made him a supporter of Al­ Haqq, and favored him with followers and helpers. Consequently, true Islam prevailed and the word of Allah became uppermost. The Shaykh persevered in his Da`wah in Al­`Uyaynah and went on teaching and guiding the people to Islam. He struggled to remove any traces of Shirk. However, when he saw that his Da`wah was not sufficiently effective, he decided to physically remove Shirk as much as he could. He told Prince `Uthman ibn Ma`mar that the dome at the grave of Zayd had to be destroyed. Zayd ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) was the brother of `Umar ibn Al­Khattab, Amir Al­Mu'minin (Commander of the Believers) ­ may Allah be pleased with all of them.",

Praise is due to Allah that the dome was destroyed and none of its traces has remained up till now. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) ensured that it was never rebuilt because it was destroyed out of sincere intention with the objective of supporting Al­Haqq. There were other graves, one of which was said to be the grave of Dirar ibn Al­Azwar, over which there was a dome that was also destroyed. Similarly, other symbols of Shirk in addition to caves and trees, which people worshiped other than Allah, were all destroyed and people were warned against this evil practice. The Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) continued in his Da`wah through words and actions. One day, a woman came to him and confessed that she had committed Zina (adultery) several times. After realizing that she was sane, married, and had confessed without any external compulsion, he gave the order that she should be stoned as a punishment, as he was Judge of Al­`Uyaynah at the time.

He became concerned, because robbery, murder, and violating sanctities were common among Bedouins, except those whom Allah had guided. He, thus, feared that the Shaykh would attain an even higher position and remove his power. He wrote to Prince `Uthman threatening him and ordering him to kill the Shaykh in Al­`Uyaynah. He wrote in the letter, \"We have heard that this person, who is living under your rule, does such and such. Either you kill him, or we will stop paying the Khiraj (tribute) which we are bound by promise to give you.\" He was to give Prince `Uthman a Khiraj of gold. `Uthman felt worried and feared that the Prince of Al­Ahsa' might not give him the Khiraj or fight him if he disobeyed his orders.
