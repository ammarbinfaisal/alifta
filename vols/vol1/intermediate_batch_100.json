They also condemned acts of major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) committed by many people such as supplicating to and seeking help of the Messenger (peace be upon him) as well as the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) buried in Al­Baqi`, the Prophet's household and other righteous people, and supplicating to the Prophet's uncle, Hamzah (may Allah be pleased with him), and to the martyrs of Battle of Uhud. Indeed, that is what is known about the followers of Imam Ibn `Abdul­Wahhab. They were known for teaching people the true essence of Islam and of disapproving of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) and superstitions which had spread in Hijaz and other places at the time. Any claim that they had shown disrespect of the Prophet's grave or A l­Rawdah or disrespect of the Prophet (peace be upon him), any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) or any righteous person is a mere fabrication and alteration of the Truth.",

They all united upon their Islamic creed, which maintained their ties with their Lord and established their loyalty to Allah, His Messenger and other Muslim brothers and sisters. Since the days of the Prophet until today, Muslims have lived under many governments and regimes and have witnessed times of regress due to some external and internal factors.

It all began when His Highness, King `Abdul-`Aziz and the knowledgeable Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah be merciful with them and may He reward them good) discussed the idea of establishing an institution to carry out the duties of Da`wah (calling to Islam) and education according to the teachings of the Salaf, represented in the call of Imam Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah have mercy on him). Some academic institutions were established, then some colleges, and with passage of time, it expanded to be an Islamic university bearing the name of the Saudi State's first founder and supporter of the Islamic call, Imam Muhammad Ibn Sa`ud. Hence, the university has graduated a huge number of scholars who have played a great role in developing this country. In addition, the university teaches the compilations of Imam Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab, especially in the field of `Aqidah (creed), plus the books of previous famous Imams among the Salaf, such as Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Al-Qayyim, Al-Tahawy, Al-Hafizh Ibn Kathir and others, may Allah have mercy on them and reward them all for their efforts in striving in Allah's Cause, defending His way and showing people the Truth as Allah commands!",

Gathering to study the Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) of Salaf, which includes Shaykh Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab's call, introducing it to people and encouraging them to hold fast to the practices of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), the Sahabah and the Salaf is obligatory and is one of the greatest ways of drawing closer to Allah. This is because it involves cooperation in goodness, discussion of righteous deeds and a way of reaching the Truth. Many a time doubt is eliminated when scholars meet and discuss debatable issues. I am certain this gathering will have great effects on the Islamic World and will make Muslims unite on the Qur'an and Sunnah, abstain from committing Bid`ah and avoid dispersion which has weakened Muslims in the face of their enemies. There is no doubt that these prominent scholars coming from all over the Islamic world to discuss research and ideas, search for the best ways for Muslims to hold fast to the Qur'an and Sunnah and revive the Madh-hab of the Salaf will achieve positive results. Scholars will benefit all Muslims and call them to the just word without any fanaticism or immoderation in relation to people and ideas, since the Truth is clear. As Muslims, we should follow everything the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah used to do whether in our houses or in our countries. This is the core of the Salafiyyah call (those following the way of the righteous predecessors), initiated by Shaykh Muhammad Ibn `Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah have mercy on him). In addition, one of the most important positive outcomes of this gathering is collecting, editing and printing all the Shaykh's compilations and writings to be available to people.

I would like also to thank the organizers of the events of this week and scholars for their participation. I ask Allah to accept all our deeds and to make them sincere for His Sake. May Allah make us of the guiding and guided, for He is the Most Generous! Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!",

Usurping by violence and terrorism is an inherently refused concept, especially in modern times after the spread of awareness among the people. The world has become like a small village and many organizations were established to defend the rights of nations, refuse political invasion, and claim the right to self determination. Every nation has the right to have sovereignty over its own territory, invest its resources, and rule its territories according to its own standards. Nations also adopt different beliefs, creeds and ruling systems, which made invaders to leave these countries after fierce, bloody wars.",

Little do you remember! Allah (Exalted be He) also states, \"And verily, this (i.e. Allâh's Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - see V.2:2).\" He (Glorified be He) also states, And this is a blessed Book (the Qur'ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has promised us a decisive victory and successful outcome in return for this, as He is the Most Truthful, in His statement, and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). He (Glorified be He) states, But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious - See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) promises, Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). He (Glorified be He) also states, O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. There are many Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions and belief, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah's orders) they were changed, according to Allah's statement, Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh). But when Allâh wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.",

The true celebration of these monuments is to follow in the footsteps of the people who did these brilliant exploits, good morality, and defended the Cause of Allah patiently and sincerely with words and actions. This is the way that the Salaf (righteous predecessors) used to glorify the good deeds of their predecessors. As for glorifying monuments by buildings, decorations and inscriptions, it is against the way of the Salaf, but it is rather the way of the Jews, the Christians and those who imitate them.

As for visiting the graves for seeking blessings, this is not permissible in Islam. Indeed, it is one of the acts of Jahiliyyah (Pre­Islamic time of ignorance) and a characteristic of grave worshipers. So, we must be aware of such acts and prohibit visitors from committing this. It is authentically reportedin Sahih (book of authentic Hadiths) Muslim on the authority of Buraydah (May Allah be pleased with him) that he said: Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) used to teach his Companions to recite the following when visiting the graves: 'Peace be upon you, the inhabitants of the graves of the believers and Muslims, and Allah willing we shall join you. We pray to Allah for well­being for ourselves and for you. In Al­Tirmidhy's book (Al­Jami`), it is related from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed by the graves of Madinah and said, \"May you be granted safety, O inmates of the graves. May Allah forgive you and us. You have preceded us, and we are to follow.'' This is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in visiting graves and showing the purpose of visiting them. As for seeking blessings from them, building over them, inscribing on them and heading to them for supplications, this is not an act of Sunnah. Rather, this is one of the traditions of the Jews, Christians, and the people of Jahiliyyah. We ask Allah to grant us and all Muslims safety.",

He added that if they had built the domes and Masjids to eternize the glorious actions of the dead, it would have been better...etc. This, however, combines both truth and falsehood. As for the truth, it is the writer's admittance that these acts of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) exist in some Islamic countries and his criticism of building domes (over graves) and Masjids as niches for worship and supplication to the dead. In fact, this is true and rampant in the neighboring countries ­ indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we will return. We ask Allah to protect Muslims from this and to grant them understanding of religion with which He sent Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in order to know that these innovations go against Shari`ah and lead to worshiping people other than Allah. Falsehood lies in the writer's differentiation between building domes and Masjids for worship and supplication, and making them memorials. This distinction has no basis in religion. Moreover, it contradicts the Divine texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, which provide for the impermissibility of building domes or Masjids for this reason. This is because building domes and Masjids over graves for worshiping, supplicating, and seeking help from the dead is an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as the people of Jahiliyyah did with Al­Lat, Al­`Uzza, Manah and other idols. Indeed, building such memorials is a means to taking the people of the graves as partners with Allah. The Qur'an and the Sunnah condemn, warn, and prohibit these means of polytheism. It is authentically reported inthe Two Sahih books of Hadith (Al­Bukhari and Muslim)from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: May Allah curse the Jews and Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their Prophets. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) was warning (Muslims) against what they had done.

It is also narrated in Sahih Muslim from Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade plastering graves, sitting on them, and building over them. These Hadiths and others, which were related in the same context, indicate the prohibition of building domes and Masjids for this reason. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned his nation against doing that to differ from the Jews and Christians who excessively glorified the dead, built places of worship on their graves, offered prayers for and supplicated to them. Thus, the Muslims may not fall prey to the means of shirk and worshiping the prophets and the righteous people besides Allah, as happened with other nations.

The writer says that those who now visit the house once inhabited by Shakespeare in Britain and the house of Beethoven in Germany do not do so out of deification, but out of admiration to what the English poet and the German musician contributed to their countries. These trivial houses cannot be compared to the house of Prophet Muhammad, Dar Al­Arqam ibn Abu A l­Arqam, Thawr Cave, Hira' Cave, and the place where Al­Rudwan Bay`ah (pledge of allegiance) and Al­Hudaybiyyah treaty took place, he said. A few years ago, Egypt registered the history of the Sphinx and the glory of the Pharaohs, and tourists came from everywhere to listen to these trivial talks compared to the glory, history and great people of Islam in all aspects. The writer suggests that Muslims should glorify Islamic monuments that are of greater importance, such as the Hira' Cave and Thawr Cave, in addition to the previously mentioned English and German sites, and the glorification of the Egyptian Pharaonic monuments.

If these monuments mentioned by the writer such as Hira' Cave, Thawr Cave, the house of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Dar Al­Arqam ibn Abu Al­Arqam, the place where A l­Rudwan Bay`ah took place and others, are glorified, their roads paved, elevators are set up and signs are erected for them, they will not be visited like the monuments of the Pharaohs and those of Kafirs; rather, they will be visited as a form of `Ibadah that draws visitors closer to Allah through them. Thus, we will have added something new to Islam that is not originally part of it, and prescribed for people what Allah has not ordained. This is the same Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) warns us against in His statement, Or have they partners (with Allâh — false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allâh has not ordained? The Prophet (peace be upon him) also warned us against it in his statement, If a person innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid reason, these are to be rejected. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also stated, \"You will certainly follow the ways of those before you as close as a feather of an arrow is to another, until even if they enter the hole of a lizard, you will enter it too.\" People asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! (Do you mean) the Jews and the Christians?\" He said, \"Who else?\" Agreed upon its authenticity by Al­Bukhari and Muslim.

As nothing of this took place, it is not part of Islam, but rather a Bid`ah which the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) against. It was authentically reported from Amir Al­Mu'minin (Commander of the Believers) `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that he condemned pursuing the monuments of prophets and ordered that the tree under which the Bay`ah of Al­Hudaybiyyah took place be cut, when he learned that some people began going there. This was meant to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and eliminate the means leading to Shirk, Bid`ah and superstitions related to Jahiliyyah (pre­Islamic time of ignorance). Below is some of what was mentioned by some scholars in this regard, so that you will be well­informed about this matter. Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Al­Walid Al­Tartushi said in his book 'Al­Hawadith wal­Bida`', a chapter entitled 'A Chapter on Forms of Bid`ah', p. 135, \"Al­Ma`rur ibn Suwayd said, 'When we went to perform Hajj with `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), we saw a Masjid (mosque) on the way, so people began offering Salah (Prayer) in it.' `Umar said, \"O, people! Those who were before you perished because of honoring such sites, until they took them as places of worship. If one arrives there at the time of Salah, one should offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.'\" On p. 141, he said on the authority of Muhammad ibn Waddah that `Umar ibn Al­Khattab ordered that the tree under which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given the Bay`ah be cut, because people began to visit it and `Umar feared that they might be misled. Ibn Waddah said, \"Malik and other scholars of Madinah hated going to the Masjids and Islamic monuments i n Madinah except Quba' and Uhud. Sufyan entered Jerusalem and offered Salah there, but he did not inquire about those monuments or offer Salah there; and others who imitated him did the same. Ibn Waddah then said, 'How many matters are now considered acceptable by many people that were once considered Munkar. People try to get closer to Allah through means that drive them further from Allah.'\" Shaykh­ul­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) said in his book 'Majmu` Al­Fatawa', Vol. 26, P. 133, \"As for climbing Mount Al­ Rahmah (at `Arafah)",

It is neither Mustahab to enter the Masjids at the place of Jamarat (stone pillars at which pebbles are thrown during Hajj) or offer Salah there. Circumambulation around them, the Stone, the room of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or anything other than the Ka`bah is a grave Bid`ah.\" He also said on p. 144 of the same section, \"As for visiting the Masjids that were built in Makkah other than Al­Masjid Al­Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), such as the one by the foot of A l­Safa, the one by the foot of Abu Qubays, and such Masjids that were built at the sites of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah, such as Masjid Al­Mawlid (the Prophet's birthday) and others, it is neither a Sunnah to visit these places, nor was it preferable by any of the Imams. It is only permissible to visit Al­Masjid A l­Haram in particular, and the sacred ritual places, such as `Arafah, Muzdalifah, Mina, Al­Safa and Al­Marwah. However, visiting the mountains and areas around Makkah other than `Arafah, Muzdalifah and Mina, such as Hira' Mountain, the mountain at Mina where it is claimed that there was the sacrifice dome and such places. it is not a Sunnah related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but rather a Bid`ah. The same applies to the Masjids built at the sites said to be monuments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not permit visiting any of these.\" In vol. 27, p. 134, of the same book, he also said, \"Some people might ask whether it is permissible to glorify a place where there is worn­out things and saffron as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was seen there. Glorification of such places and turning them into Masjids is an imitation of the People of the Book whom we are prohibited to imitate. It was authentically reported that `Umar ibn Al­Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) was traveling when he saw a group of people hurrying to a place. He asked, 'What is this?' People replied, 'It is a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.' He said, 'Do you want to turn the sites of your prophet into Masjids? If the time of Salah comes while a person is there, they can offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.' `Umar said this in the presence of a number of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah in many places while traveling, and the people would see him",
