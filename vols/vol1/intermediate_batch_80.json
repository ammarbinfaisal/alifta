Indeed, the ranks of those who don the veil of Arabism, infiltrate the ranks of Al­Mujahideen (those who strive in the Cause of Allah) and claim that they are missionaries of Arab Nationalism and the bearers of its banners, but at the same time they withdrew from Arabic traditions, attack the best thing that ever happened to it and place hindrances in the way of faith and its message. Their veil should be removed from their shameless faces and light should be shed on their motives which colonization facilitated for them. They stood back to watch its bitter results, which are but the intended destruction of the Qur'anic message and its great conveyor Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Verily, we have read what they write and listened to what they say and we have not lacked the intelligence to know their goals, since they are atheists displaying their disbelief.

Indeed, the claim that Islam is an Arab outburst is a big lie and a disgraceful deception. This is not only a spurning of Islam, but it is a dangerous call to reject all faiths and to spread disbelief, evil and disobedience throughout the world. What is astonishing, is that those who vehemently oppose Islam attack Muslims unjustly and make peace with those of other revealed faiths and manmade religions, as if Islam alone is the enemy against and they have been commissioned to eradicate it. Nay, it is the strong hindrance for which they have been given the axes to collapse into dust. Yes, this is the truth. Is there an enemy to colonization in these countries other than Islam? It is the source of the stubborn resistance and the spirit of the courageous struggle which has frustrated the attackers and thwarted their conspiracies. Therefore, colonization must weave its strings around it to kill it and to stand as an obstacle between it and living lives of dignity and honor. Verily, colonization has invented limited nationalism and subjected them by different means in order to destroy the fabric of our faith.

These correponding mistakes are a result of the mankind's longing for pre­Islamic ignorance and their laziness in struggling to achieve their human potential. Thus, if it becomes difficult for a common person to be righteous whose actions connect him with glory and nobilty, then he will look for another connection with family, country or race in order to be elevated through it without much effort. All such acts are unwarranted partisanship and false illusions having no place in Islam and no merit with the Lord of the worlds. The most important thing to know is that when the first Arabs sought honor and distinction, Islam was their support and the seat of their pride. Then, what will they fill their mouths with if they do not mention Islam? Indeed, they were empty­handed and their history was nil, until the liars came in our time with innovations about which no one had heard before.

Another writer from this gang insists that we forget history because it merely immortalizes the ashes of the dead, and to only look forward to the future. This heedless writer has forgotten that the Jews in the center of the Middle East, have founded their country with a provision inspired from history and they used the name Israel. It seems that it is lawful for all people to accompany their history in their struggle, but for us as Muslims, it is unlawful to mention any part of this history and to seek from it a help in striving or hope as a support. Indeed, it is Hebrew Nationalism, not Arab Nationalism. It is that which atheists and those who hate Islam propagate.

When there is a community of this type, colonization will be at rest in its present day and thereafter. Thus, when Islam comes to remove these abominations, it is quickly requested to return to its hole and disappear from the scene.

It will quickly be destroyed at his hands, or at least, it best it will be less productive if it remains unbroken.

How can wise people draw a comparison between nationalism, which might have been supported by Abu Jahl, `Utbah Ibn Rabi`ah, Shaybah Ibn Rabi`ah, and other enemies of Islam, if they were alive and an honorable religion that suits all times and places, and its supporters and advocates are Muhammad (peace be upon him), Abu Bakr Al­Siddiq, `Umar Ibn Al­Khattab, `Uthman Ibn `Affan, `Aly Ibn Abu Talib, and other Companions, as well as those who followed their guidance,",

It is known that doctors examine diseases and do their best to find a suitable cure for each disease, beginning with the most fatal of such diseases. This was the way of the best of all creatures, Muhammad (peace be upon him) who, when he was sent by Allah to mankind, forbade people to commit the worst of all sins, Shirk (associating others in worship along with Allah). That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) kept on warning people against Shirk and calling them to Tawhid (monotheism) for ten years after which he began to enjoin people to perform Salah (Prayer) and do other obligatory acts of worship. Similarly, preachers should follow his guidance by tackling the most important issues first and then the lesser ones. However, if the society is a Muslim one, a preacher can discuss both important and ordinary issues alike, and had actually better do so as much as he can. This is because a preacher has to do his best to reform the Muslim society and remove any misconceptions relating to Islamic `Aqidah (Creed) and purify the Muslim nation from any corrupt manner that may harm the Muslim society and weaken its faith. A preacher can begin his sermons by tackling ordinary issues if he has no chance to discuss the most important issues. He can prioritize some issues and delay some others in case he sees that it is better to begin with important issues and is afraid that being occupied with all issues may",
