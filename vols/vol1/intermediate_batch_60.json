This is what Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah bestow His mercy upon him) believed in, accepted as his religion and invited others to. Whoever attributes something different from that to him, then he lies and invents a manifest sin and says something about which he has no knowledge. So, Allah (Exalted be He) will punish him with the punishment He threatened the like of him from those who invent sins. Moreover, he (may Allah bestow His mercy upon him) produced useful reports, unique researches and great compilations with regard to sincerity, monotheism, bearing witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and what has been proved by the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the consensus of opinion including the negation of the right of worship and godhood for other than Allah and confirming them to Allah (Exalted be He) in a perfect way that contradicts minor and major polytheism. Whoever is acquainted with his writings and what was transmitted from him or known and become widespread from his Da'wah (call to Islam) and affairs, and what has been practiced by his notable companions and students, will find that the Shaykh followed the practice of the righteous predecessors and the leaders of religion and guidance of sincere worship to Allah, the One and Only, and avoided innovations in religion and superstitions. Saudi Arabia is based on this principle and its scholars, praise be to Allah, follow that way. The government of Saudi Arabia is persistent against innovations in religion and superstitions that have been inserted into the religion of Islam that exceed the proper limits prohibited by the Messenger (peace be upon him). It is noted that scholars and Muslims in Saudi Arabia as well as their rulers have a great deal of respect for every Muslim and harbor all kinds of loyalty, love and appreciation regardless of their nationality. They only deny what the followers of deviated beliefs do including innovations in religion and superstitions and innovated celebrations. They deny the initiation of such festivals and celebrating them as long as Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) did not allow them and prohibited such celebrations. This is because they are invented issues in religion and every invented issue in religion is an innovation and Muslims are commanded not to follow them and are prohibited to innovate, because of the perfection of the religion of Islam and because of what Allah (Exalted be He)",
