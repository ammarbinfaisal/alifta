They give them names such as Qutb (Sufi title denoting a \"Perfect Master\"), Watad (a Sufi title), Ghawth (a Sufi title denoting a \"source of succor\"), as well as other names which they gave to their gods. Indeed, this is the worst form of Shirk with relation to Allah's Lordship; it is even far worse than the form of Shirk which was prevalent in Pre­Islamic Arabia.

These sects completely deny Allah's Perfect Attributes. They give Him attributes of inanimate beings. Far is He above what they ascribe to Him! Other sects such as Al­Asha`irah (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic) deny some of the Attributes while confirming others, thus contradicting clear logical as well as textual evidence. However, Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­ Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) confirmed all the Names and Attributes that Allah has confirmed for Himself in the Qur'an or through His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). They set Him far above His creation, as there is no one who resembles Him in anything. They refer to all proofs in the Qur'an and the Sunnah without twisting the meaning thereof in the least. In this way, they avoided confusion into which others have fallen. This belief is the way to salvation and bliss in this world and in the Hereafter. It is the Straight Path followed by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and the leaders of this Ummah (Nation).
