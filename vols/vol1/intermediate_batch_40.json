Therefore, anyone who calls upon the dead prophets or others, or idols, trees, stones, or any other creatures, or appeals to any of them for support, or tries to get close to them by offering sacrifices, making vows, prays or prostrates to them, has taken them as their lords instead of Allah and made them equal to Him (Exalted be He). This is certainly a breach of this principle; it negates the meaning of there is no deity but Allah. Also, anyone who introduces a Bid'ah (innovation in religion) that Allah has not permitted, has not realized the meaning of the Shahadah that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust. Such are the deeds done by those who died as Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and those who practice Bid'ah. On the Day of Resurrection these deeds will be like scattered dust, as they are not in accordance with Allah's Purified Law. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Anyone who introduces something in this matter of ours (the religion) that is not from it, will have it rejected.\" (Agreed upon by Al­Bukhari and Muslim) This writer has addressed her invocation for help and support to the Messenger (peace be upon him) and turned away from Allah, the Lord of the worlds, in Whose Hand is support, harm and benefit. None other than Him has control over any of these things.",
