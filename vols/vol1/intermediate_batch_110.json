This is because such an act may lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and excessive veneration and overpraising of the prophets and pious people. The reality bears witness to the validity of what the Shari`ah asserts, evidence that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and unquestionable, decisive proof regarding the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down unto him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk.

However, supplicating to Allah for a charitable person without putting hands on the money that is given in charity or raising the voice with supplication as you mentioned is permissible. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Requite him who does a favor to you. However, if you are unable to requite him, pray to Allah for him till you are sure that you have requited him adequately.'' (Related by Abu Dawud and Al­Nasa'y with an authentic Isnad (chain of transmitters)). Allah is the One Whose help is sought.",
