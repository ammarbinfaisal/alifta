Many Muslims follow in the footsteps of those from previous nations, such as the Jews, the Christians, the Magi and other Kafirs in their morals and deeds, until Islam is estranged and Muslims prefer the guidance of the Kafirs over that of Muslims. Many Muslims see good deeds as evil and evil deeds as good and acts of Sunnah as Bid`ahs while Bid`ahs are regarded of the Sunnah due to their ignorance and negligence of Islamic teachings, morals and deeds. Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. May Allah guide Muslims to understanding His Way, set right their affairs and guide their rulers to what is good. May Allah grant scholars success and aid writers to promote Islam and warn people against Bid`ah that give it a false reputation, for Allah is Powerful over all things. Peace and blessings be upon Allah's Servant and Messenger Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance and Sunnah until the Day of Resurrection!",

May Allah bless this gathering and make it useful for all Muslims, helping them to obey Allah and combat false doctrines and corrupt ideas. I thank Him (He may be Glorified) for prescribing the obligation of Hajj (pilgrimage) to His Sacred House where Muslims from all over the world meet each other: That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade), and mention the Name of Allâh on appointed days (i.e. 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th day of Dhul­Hijjah), over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice), [at the time of their slaughtering by saying: (Bismillah, Wallâhu­ Akbar, Allâhumma Minka wa Ilaik)]. They gather to worship Him alone, single Him out with all forms of good deeds, and submit their needs to Him at His Ancient House as well as in the Sacred Rites. They supplicate to Him at `Arafat and Muzdalifah to ask for His forgiveness, accepting their Hajj, saving them from Hellfire, circumambulating His Ancient House, and walking between Al­Safa and Al­Marwah, seeking His Mercy and fearing His punishment as did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Companions.

Allah (may He be Praised and Glorified) prescribed it yearly as a supererogatory act in order to draw closer to Him. As for the obligation, it must be fulfilled once in a lifetime for those who can afford it.

Allah (Exalted be He) says: Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allâh, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much. (See the Qur'ân Verse 35:45). Allah (Supreme is His Might) is Forbearing, Oft­Forgiving and Merciful towards His Servants. He sent them signs and warners so they would return to Him, and He accepts their Tawbah (repentance to Allah). When a Servant draws closer to their Lord (may He be Praised) a hand's length, He (may He be Praised) draws closer to them an arm's length, because Allah (Exalted be He) loves that His Servants make Tawbah and is pleased with it, even though He is in no need of His Servants. He (Exalted be He) is not benefitted by any acts of obedience nor is He harmed by any acts of disobedience from the humans and Jinn. But He is Compassionate and Merciful with His Servants and He is the One Who guides them to obey Him and avoid disobeying Him. These crises and disasters are no more than warners for Allah's Servants to return to Him (Exalted be He) and ordeals by which He tests them. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to A s­Sâbirûn (the patient).",
