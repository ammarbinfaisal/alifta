Allah (Exalted be He) says: Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment. He (Glorified be He) also says: By Al­'Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al­Ma'ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al­Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh's Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd). Further, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Religion is sincerity!\" They said, \"To whom, O Messenger of Allah?\" He (peace be upon him) answered, \"To Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and the Imams (leaders) of Muslims and their common people.\" (Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])These Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and Hadith stress the obligation of advising one another, helping one another in goodness and exhorting one another to the Truth. Therefore, if a Muslim finds their brother neglecting any of the duties that Allah has laid upon him or committing a prohibited act, they should advise him, enjoin good and forbid evil with the aim of having a better society full of goodness and free from evil. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ' (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma'rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden)",

(Related by Muslim in his Sahih)Dear questioner, since you have advised your Muslim brother and guided him to the Right Path but he still insists on committing sins openly, you should abandon him and not take him as your friend. You should encourage others who may have an influence on him or whom he respects more to advise him and invite him to Allah, maybe he will be guided. However, if you find that abandoning him makes him commit more sins whereas being in contact with him deters him and is better for his religion, do not abandon him. Basically, abandonment is meant as a remedy and if the remedy increases the illness, drop it and keep on advising him, enjoining good and forbidding evil without taking him as a companion or a close friend, may Allah bring benefit by it. This is the best opinion given by Muslim scholars (may Allah be merciful to them all) in this regard.",

We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide your father and help him to repent. We advise you to be lenient with him and to offer him advice in a kind way and never to give up the hope of his being guided. Allah (Glorified be He) says, And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years ­ give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) orders us to thank parents along with thanking Him and to accompany them in this worldly life with appropriate kindness, even if they strive to make one disbelieve in Allah. Thus, you learn that Islam enjoins on you to behave kindly with your father and do good to him even if he does you wrong. You should strive to call him to Al­Haqq (the Truth), hoping that Allah may guide him through you. It is not permissible for you to obey him in a sin. We advise you also to seek help from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to guide him and then from your righteous relatives such as uncles and others whom your father appreciate and respect hoping that he may accept their advice. We ask Allah to grant us, you and your father guidance and sincere Tawbah. He is All­ Hearer, Ever Near.

Anyone who rules by laws other than those laid down by Allah while knowing the obligation of ruling according to the Law revealed by Allah, and is aware that by doing so they have violated the Shari'ah (Islamic law), but in spite of this they regard this matter as permissible and believe that they have done nothing wrong and that it is permissible to rule by other than Allah's Law is a Kafir (disbeliever) who is guilty of major Kufr (disbelief) according to all Muslim scholars. Ruling according to other than Shari'ah includes judgment according to man­made laws which are laid down by Christians, Jews and the like who claim that it is permissible to use these laws in judgment, or claim that they are better than or as good as Allah's Laws, and that people have the choice either to rule according to the Qur'an and Sunnah or man­made laws. Indeed, anyone who believes in the validity of these aforementioned claims has committed Kufr by the Ijma' (consensus) of Muslim scholars as mentioned previously. As for those who rule by other than Allah's revealed Law to satisfy an inclination or to secure a transient worldly gain, while admitting that by doing so they are disobeying Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and have committed a grave Munkar (an act unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and that it is obligatory on them to rule according to Allah's Law, they will not be guilty of major Kufr. Nevertheless, they are guilty of a grave Munkar, a major sin and a minor act of Kufr (disbelief); this is the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and other scholars. By doing so they are judged to have committed an act of Kufr, Zhulm (injustice), and Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law) that does take them out of Islam, as it does not constitute major Kufr.",
