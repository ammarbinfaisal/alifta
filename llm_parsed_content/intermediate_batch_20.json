Wrongdoers live in pain in this life, in the grave and the Hereafter even if they already live in limitless ease in this life. This is because real happiness and ease are those of the heart. Believers, who depend on Allah, are satisfied with Him, fulfill His Rights and are truthful to His Promise, have peace of mind, and feel delighted and satisfied. In contrast, wrongdoers with evil­oriented hearts, ignorance, doubt, and negligence of the Rights of Allah and are occupied with the matters of life and its desires live in continuous pain, worry and hardship. Yet, following whims and inclinations makes the mind blind so that it does not think of this.",

He showed the people the Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances) and Du`a' (supplication) which they must say while performing Tawaf (circumambulation around Al­Ka`bah) and Sa`y (going between Safa and Marwah during Hajj and `Umrah) and while being in `Arafat, Muzdalifah, and Mina. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) pointed this out in the Qur'an by saying: There is no sin on you if you seek the Bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading). Then when you leave 'Arafât, remember Allâh (by glorifying His Praises, i.e. prayers and invocations) at the Mash'ar­il­Harâm . And remember Him (by invoking Allâh for all good.) as He has guided you, and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray. Then depart from the place whence all the people depart and ask Allâh for His Forgiveness.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever performs Hajj and does not have sexual relations (with their wives) nor commits sins (during Hajj) will return (as sinless) as a newborn baby. This denotes that it is not permissible to have sexual relations before Tahallul (removal of the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) or to say or commit anything calling to this as it is not permissible to commit sins, whether verbally or practically. Also, one must refrain from engaging in disputes except for the sake of achieving goodness.

So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihrâm), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. In fact, all the rituals of Hajj represent an invitation to obey Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), to glorify and remember Allah, to abstain from committing sins, and to refrain from engaging in disputes which cause enmity and division among the Muslims.

When calling others, a Da`y (caller to Islam) must use wisdom, which is knowledge of what Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger has ordained, and fair preaching; and must not be harsh or hurt people. It is permissible to engage in a dispute in a way that is better whenever it is necessary to remove doubts and explain Al­Haqq.

Thus, Muslims have flocked from all around the world for the sake of reward, seeking Paradise and supporting their weak fellow Muslims. Thus, Jihad took on an international form and the reality of Muslim brotherhood has been reinforced inside Muslims. However, this brotherhood, consequentially, has irritated unbelievers all over the world. Allah (Exalted be He) made their plots fail to divide Muslims or inflict them with loss; rather, He made the Mujahideen victorious. The enemies of religion are now resorting to another means to spread difference and animosity among Muslims through doctrinal disputes that exist among Muslims since ancient times. They lit turmoil and aroused the masses to spoil the relation between the Afghan Mujahideen and their fellow Muslims and no one is able to put off this turmoil but you, scholars.",
