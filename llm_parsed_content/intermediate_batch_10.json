May peace and blessings be upon the master of the early and late generations, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and upon all prophets, messengers, and righteous people. It is admittedly true that Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and belief in Allah's Messengers is the most important and greatest obligation. Similarly, attaining this kind of knowledge is the best and most honorable science. Moreover, there is a pressing need for explaining it in detail. It is for these reasons that I take upon myself to clarify this issue in brief. Indeed, this great subject deserves to be given greater consideration. So, I pray to Allah (May He be Glorified and Exalted) to grant us all success in words and deeds and to protect us all from mistakes and errors.",

However, the dispute and enmity, from the time of Nuh (Noah peace be upon him) to the present day rises concerning the issue of dedicating `Ibadah to Allah Alone. Messengers were sent to call people to dedicate `Ibadah to Allah, believe in His Oneness, and abandon dedicating `Ibadah to anyone other than Him. The opponents held the belief that they should worship Him along with others as well, not to devote `Ibadah to Him Alone.",

Finally, Allah made His religion victorious, supported His call and helped the Prophet (peace be upon him) against his enemies until he was satisfied before his death when he saw the religion was victorious. Thus, Al­Haqq (the Truth) has become established, Tawhid has spread on earth, and idols were eliminated after he conquered Makkah in Ramadan, 8th A.H. People entered into the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) in crowds as a result of this conquest. Eventually, Quraysh accepted Islam and then the Arab tribes accepted Tawhid, sincerity and Shari`ah to which the Prophet (peace be upon him) called them. In conclusion, the Prophet (peace be upon him) called to the same teachings as the previous messengers since prophet Nuh and those who followed him. This call was mainly about Tawhid, sincerity, and avoiding the worship of anything else but Allah (Exalted be He). This is his first Da`wah (calling to Islam), its core, and the most important and great obligation. The children of Adam were on pure Tawhid since Adam to Nuh for ten centuries as Ibn `Abbas and his students said. However, when they disagreed over polytheism that had spread among the people of Nuh, Allah (Exalted be He) sent messengers. Allah (Exalted be He) says:",

When polytheism spread among the people of Nuh because of their over­estimation of the pious and because Satan allured them to worship those pious people instead of Allah (Exalted be He), He sent them Nuh (peace be upon him) to call them to Tawhid, sincerity and avoiding worship of other than Allah. So, Nuh (peace be upon him) was the first messenger sent by Allah (Exalted be He) to the people on earth after the spread of polytheism. As for Adam, weak narrations mention his prophethood but they are weak and undependable because of their weak chain of narration. There is no doubt that a Shari`ah was revealed to him from his Lord.

Allah (Exalted be He) informed us about the stories of some of them and did not inform us about the stories of the others, because of His great wisdom. The most important thing is to know that they all called for Tawhid and devotion of worship for Him (may He be Praised and Glorified). They also called their nations to devotion and some of them accepted the call while others refused. Some of the prophets were followed by only a few while others could not find anyone to follow, as is reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the seal and the best of the prophets. His whole account with his people who fought and acted hostilely against him in Makkah Al­Mukarramah is well known. He and his Sahabah underwent a great deal of harm to the extent that people conspired to kill him but Allah (Exalted be He) rescued him. In Al­Madinah, great battles and Jihad took place until Allah (Exalted be He) supported him and made him victorious. Thus, it is clear for all that the essence of the call of all the messengers was Tawhid and sincerity to Allah (Exalted be He). All the prophets and messengers called for Tawhid, sincerity to Allah, believing in His Names, Attributes, and Actions. Allah (Exalted be He) is One in His Lordship, Names, Attributes, and also One in worship. No one deserves worship, neither a prophet nor a king nor a pious person, because worship is solely for Allah (Exalted be He). It is for the sake of worship that Allah (Exalted be He) created all creatures and sent the prophets, as He says: And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone). Allah (Exalted be He) says: And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût (all false deities i.e. do not worship Tâghût besides Allâh).\"",

All the messengers conveyed this message and called for their Lord. Polytheism, which spread among mankind, still has an impact until now. Some people still worship idols, over­estimate the righteous and the prophets, and worship them instead of Allah (Exalted be He), as it is known to all people since the time of Nuh up to the present day.

Please inform me of your address after the end of the academic year, so as to be able to send you the answers to the rest of your questions. May Allah guide us all to know the Truth and to follow it! We seek refuge with Him from misguiding trials, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Near! You asked about the meaning of the word \"Ma`iyyah\" and here is the answer. Allah (Glorified be He) mentions two types of Ma`iyyah (Allah being with His creation): general and particular. The first is mentioned in the Ayah (Qur'anic verse): And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. The second is mentioned in the Ayah: Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us. and: I am with you both, hearing and seeing. There are other Ayahs to the same effect. Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) are of the opinion that Ma`iyyah is one of the Attributes of Allah (Glorified be He) as befits His Glory.

Allah (Glorified be He) is the Most High despite His Nearness and the Most Near despite His Highness. The two Attributes of Ma`iyyah and `Uluw - in a manner that befits Allah - do not involve Tashbih (comparison) to one of His creations or negate one another. Jahmiyyah and Mu`tazilah (deviant Islamic sects) uses the Ayahs to prove Allah's Ma`iyyah, deny Allah's `Uluw and claim that He is Omnipresent. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) denied these claims and agreed that Allah's Ma`iyyah entails His Knowledge of His servants' affairs despite His Istiwa'. That is why Allah begins and ends the Ayahs referring to general Ma`iyyah by mentioning His Knowledge in order to inform His servants that His Ma`iyyah entails His encompassing Knowledge of their affairs. Based upon this, the majority of the Salaf scholars have interpreted the Ayahs which mention Ma`iyyah as referring to Allah's Knowledge. Other scholars have discussed Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah's consensus on interpreting Ayahs talking about Ma`iyyah as referring to Allah's Knowledge and denying the claims of Jahmiyyah and Mu`tazilah, who say Allah is Omnipresent and who deny His Attributes of `Uluw and Istiwa' (May Allah curse them! How can they deny the Truth). Thus, we know that interpreting the word \"Ma`iyyah\" as Knowledge is not only the opinion of Shaykh Taqiy Al-Din only, but is also the opinion of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. The Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) wrote in his book \"Al-Wasitiyyah\" what supports the obligation of believing in the two Attributes of Allah, namely `Uluw and Ma`iyyah without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning) and false claims. You can refer to the book if you are interested. In general, the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) meant that it is obligatory to confirm the Ma`iyyah and `Uluw of Allah above the Throne in a manner that befits Him and does not compare Him to any of His creations. Al-Hafizh ibn Kathir (may Allah be merciful with him) while interpreting the Ayah: There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) he said, \"The majority of scholars agree that what is meant in this Ayah,",

These words do not negate interpreting Ma`iyyah as knowledge, since it is what is meant and intended by it. This is the true meaning of it. Ma`iyyah refers to Allah's Knowledge of all things related to the affairs of His servants, as for its manner, it is only known to Allah just as the rest of His Attributes. Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe in the Names and Attributes of Allah and understand their meanings but do not know their manner. Only Allah knows the exact manner of assuming His Attributes, as He alone knows His Dhat (Essence). Exalted and Glorified be He above the false claims of those who deny or compare His Attributes to those of humans. Imam Malik (may Allah be merciful with him) and other scholars among Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah said, \"Allah's Istiwa' is known, its manner is unknown, and believing in it is obligatory.\" This is the adopted view in relation to all of Allah's Attributes and Allah knows best. As for standing up for the teacher when he enters the classroom, many Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith) support the view that it is Makruh (reprehensible) or even Haram (prohibited). It is related on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, \"None was more beloved to them (i.e., the Companions) than the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but they did not stand up upon seeing him, for they knew how much he hated that.\" (Related by Ahmad and Al-Tirmidhy who termed the Hadith as Hasan (good), Sahih (authentic) and Gharib (a Hadith with a single narrator usually at the beginning of the chain of narration))",

Some scholars exclude from the ruling in these Hadith someone standing up to welcome a returning traveler, or a long-time friend to shake their hands or embrace them. Other scholars excluded a son standing up for his father to honor or help him, while a father may stand up for his son if he deserves it. What is meant here is standing up to greet and shake hands with the other and in this sense, the exclusion is valid and is supported by evidence from the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).It is related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim)that when Sa`d ibn Mu`adh came to pass judgment on Qurayzhah (a Jewish tribe), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), \"Stand and receive your chieftain.\" He (peace be upon him) meant ordering them to get up to greet him and help him dismount.Here is another Hadith related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadithon the authority of Ka`b ibn Malik, \"After Allah revealed the acceptance of his Tawbah (repentance to Allah), he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Masjid (mosque) while the people were sitting around him. Upon seeing Ka`b, Talhah ibn `Ubaydullah got up quickly and went to shake his hand and congratulate him for Allah's Acceptance of his Tawbah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not deny this act.\" Further, it is related by Abu Dawud, A l-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa'y with a good Sanadon the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she narrated, \"When the Prophet (peace be upon him) would visit Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), she would get up to (welcome) him, take him by the hand, kiss him, and have him sit in her seat. When she came to visit him, he (peace be upon him) would stand to (welcome) her, take her by the hand, kiss her and have her sit in his seat\". All these Hadiths clearly support the permissibility of getting up for another Muslim in these cases and prove it is not reprehensible. However, some Muslims today stand whenever their teacher enters to show him respect not to shake hands with him. They only stand up to show respect and honor then sit again. There is no doubt in the undesirability of this act. In addition, a teacher and the like should not approve of this behavior, based on the previous Hadith related on the authority of Mu`awiyah and other Hadiths. In fact, scholars, teachers, knowledge seekers, rulers and prominent figures in the community are the ones most entitled to following the Sunnah and applying its teachings.",

It is evidently true that the Prophet (peace be upon him) who conveyed the Message of Allah informed his Ummah that Allah (may He be Praised) is High above His Throne and above Heavens. This goes for the Fitrah (natural disposition) upon which Allah created all nations, whether Arabs or non-Arabs, at the times of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic period) and after Islam.

This has been made clear in the words of Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful with him) with regard to explaining the Istiwa' with Allah's establishing Himself above the Throne. Belief in it is Wajib (obligatory) and the way it is done is only known to Allah (may He be Praised).
