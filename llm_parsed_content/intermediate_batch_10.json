Some people have told her that if someone is suffering from a serious illness, Surah Al­Zalzalah should be read over water, and if the person who is ill drinks it, they will either be cured or die. She asked someone to recite this for her and she drank the water they recited over. After a period of time, the woman became pregnant, so she drank some of the water and she gave birth to a healthy baby. Then, after weaning him, she became pregnant again. During the ninth month, her illness returned, so she drank some of the water again. However, on the same day, she gave birth to a stillborn baby. After another period of time, she became pregnant once again and her illness returned again, so she drank some of the same water. In the eighth month of her pregnancy, she gave birth to another stillborn baby. After a further period of time, she became pregnant again and in the seventh month, her illness returned, she drank some of the water, and the following night she gave birth to a living baby daughter. I have heard people say that reading Surah Al­Zalzalah over water and drinking it causes miscarriages, if the water contains black cumin. She did not know about this, so is she to blame for the children who died?",

Thus, the Ayah means that those who have complete fear of Allah are those who know their Lord through His Names and Attributes and His Great Right and they are aware of His Shari'ah (Divine Law) and believe in the blessings stored for those who fear Him and the punishment stored for those who forsake and disobey Him. Hence, because of their profound knowledge about Allah, they are the most fearful and reverential towards Allah; and at the head of them are the prophets and messengers (peace be upon them) and then their succeeding scholars who possess knowledge about Allah and His Din but their fear is in varying degrees. However, the Ayah does not mean that no one fears Allah except the scholars (those who possess knowledge). All Muslims and believers, male and female, fear Allah, but their fear is in varying degrees and not of the same grade. Therefore, the more the believer possesses knowledge about Allah and comprehends His Din, the greater is their fear of Allah. If their knowledge is less, so is their understanding and awareness of Allah and His Din and subsequently their fear of Allah. Thus, people are of varying degrees in this matter and so are the scholars as already stated. The more there is knowledge about Din, the greater there is fear of Allah and the less there is knowledge about Din, the less there is fear of Allah. That is why Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) including all obligations ordered by Islâm] and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures.",

That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allâh, i.e. commit crimes and sins).    In another narration, it reads:  \"The first failing to begin among the Children of Israel was that a man would meet another man and say, 'O so and so! Fear Allah and abstain from what you are doing. It is not lawful for you.' Then he would meet him again the next day but this (the sin he saw him doing) would not prevent him from eating, drinking and sitting with him. When they did this, Allah caused the hearts of some to be tainted by the others.\"",
