The point is that he first asked about the requirements of Iman because it purifies the Muslim inwardly in a way that is reflected upon his outward behavior. This is why Allah defined Islam as outward submission because it has to do with a Muslim's submissiveness to Allah (may He be Praised). The word \"Islam\" indicates submission to Allah (Exalted be He), and obeying His Commands.

When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about Iman, he said, To have faith in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and the Divine destiny whether good or bad. He explained Iman as believing in these six matters which are essentially the fundamentals of Faith and the Deen of Islam, for whoever lacks Iman has no share in Islam, and whoever lacks Islam is not a Mu'min (believer). Accordingly, believing in these essential requirements of Iman is a prerequisite for the validity of one's Islam. However, a Muslim's Iman might be perfect or not, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) stated about the Bedouins: Say: \"You believe not but you only say, 'We have surrendered (in Islâm)\"",

He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should keep good relation with his Kith and kin. He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should not hurt his neighbors. To explain it further, Iman entails practicing good deeds. Thus, Islam without Iman is the act of hypocrites. The perfect Iman necessitates abiding by what Allah and His Messenger commanded and refraining from what they forbade. If a Muslim falls short in adhering to this, then he is not a believer as Allah negated Iman from the Bedouins in His statement: Say: \"You believe not but you only say, 'We have surrendered (in Islâm)\" and as negated also by the previous Hadiths.",
