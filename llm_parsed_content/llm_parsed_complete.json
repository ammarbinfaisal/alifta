Thus, the Ayah means that those who have complete fear of Allah are those who know their Lord through His Names and Attributes and His Great Right and they are aware of His Shari'ah (Divine Law) and believe in the blessings stored for those who fear Him and the punishment stored for those who forsake and disobey Him. Hence, because of their profound knowledge about Allah, they are the most fearful and reverential towards Allah; and at the head of them are the prophets and messengers (peace be upon them) and then their succeeding scholars who possess knowledge about Allah and His Din but their fear is in varying degrees. However, the Ayah does not mean that no one fears Allah except the scholars (those who possess knowledge). All Muslims and believers, male and female, fear Allah, but their fear is in varying degrees and not of the same grade. Therefore, the more the believer possesses knowledge about Allah and comprehends His Din, the greater is their fear of Allah. If their knowledge is less, so is their understanding and awareness of Allah and His Din and subsequently their fear of Allah. Thus, people are of varying degrees in this matter and so are the scholars as already stated. The more there is knowledge about Din, the greater there is fear of Allah and the less there is knowledge about Din, the less there is fear of Allah. That is why Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) including all obligations ordered by Islâm] and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures.",

That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allâh, i.e. commit crimes and sins).    In another narration, it reads:  \"The first failing to begin among the Children of Israel was that a man would meet another man and say, 'O so and so! Fear Allah and abstain from what you are doing. It is not lawful for you.' Then he would meet him again the next day but this (the sin he saw him doing) would not prevent him from eating, drinking and sitting with him. When they did this, Allah caused the hearts of some to be tainted by the others.\"",

It is not permissible for non-Muslims to live in this Peninsula due to the reasons mentioned above, except for a pressing need, like vendors who sell imported goods and non-Muslim envoys coming as representatives of their countries to meet with top officials in this Peninsula. However, it is not permissible to allow them permanent residence in this country. Also, it is not permissible to give them citizenship, as this will facilitate their permanent residence, due to the Messenger's (peace be upon him) command mentioned earlier. Any non-Muslim who is permitted to enter the country must be prevented from publicly practicing their religious rites. Bringing them to the Arabian Peninsula for employment is not permissible. Rather, Muslims are to beware of them and to dispense with them by appointing Muslim workers. Muslims should be given priority to occupy all vacancies. However, in some special cases, this restriction can be lifted when there is an extreme necessity deemed by those in authority. Therefore, non-Muslims may be recruited to take jobs or professions that Muslims cannot do. Upon completing such tasks, they are to be returned to their countries. The Prophet (peace be upon him) permitted the Jews to stay in Khaybar when there was a need for that.

The Masjid and the Minbar are the most important means that can be used for conveying this Message and spreading Da`wah, as the Masjid is the place where Muslims gather for many events, such as the Jumu`ah (Friday) Prayer.

Also it embraces doing good deeds, as iman is words and deeds; it increases by obedience and decreases by sin, according to the understanding of Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama'ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body). True Iman is spoken by the heart, and on the lips, and expressed by the action of the heart and body; the action of the heart is through love, devotion, fear, hope, and longing for Allah.

Thus, Hajj is a Faridah (obligatory act) that must be performed only once during one's lifetime. It is obligatory for Muslims, males and females, who are Mukallaf and can afford its expenses. It is considered a Nafilah (a supererogatory act of worship) and an act of drawing closer to Allah (Exalted be He) for whoever has performed it once and performs it more times.

Special care should be taken with regard to refraining from disobeying Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and being unjust to people and harming them either by words or actions. A believer cares about helping his brothers in Islam, treating them kindly, guiding them to what is good, and explaining to them the matters which they might be unaware of regarding Allah's Shar`. They must beware of harming others or wronging their lives, property, and honor. Muslims are brothers and must not wrong, despise, or let each other down; rather, they must love what is good and hate what is bad for each other, wherever they are, especially in the Ka`bah and its safe Haram (all areas within the Sacred Sanctuary of Makkah) and the city of the Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah has, indeed, made the Haram safe from everything which may evoke the people's fear. Therefore, Muslims must be keen on being sincere and honest with each other by exchanging advice and guidance, and must not cheat, deceive, or hurt each other whether by sayings or actions. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And (remember) when We made the House (the Ka'bah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves",

Indeed, there should be a kind of support and help for those persons to accomplish their mission along the way. I advise them to be on their guard against extravagance and negligence since every Islamic call or action is afflicted with one of two satanic insinuations: remissness and excessiveness. Therefore, scholars and people of insight should support this call and direct those who lead it toward moderation and warn them against excessiveness, lest this should lead them to Bid`ah (innovated in religion) or failing to fulfill the rights of Allah (Exalted be He). I appeal to them to Islamize their call through adherence to the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) and the right path. This can be achieved through devotion to Allah (Exalted be He) and following His Messenger (peace be upon him) with neither excessiveness nor remissness. If they do so, this Islamic movement will be fruitful. The leaders of this movement in particular should be interested in this matter and attend to it, thus avoiding both opposite ends. Allah is the One Who grants success.",

Muslims should also beware of innovations in Islam ­ as Allah has warned ­ that lead to imitating the enemies of Allah and following their Bid`ah.

Allah (Glorified be He) states: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents.

His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years ­ give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.

Allah (Supreme is His Might) is Forbearing, Oft­Forgiving and Merciful towards His Servants. He sent them signs and warners so they would return to Him, and He accepts their Tawbah (repentance to Allah). When a Servant draws closer to their Lord (may He be Praised) a hand's length, He (may He be Praised) draws closer to them an arm's length, because Allah (Exalted be He) loves that His Servants make Tawbah and is pleased with it, even though He is in no need of His Servants. He (Exalted be He) is not benefitted by any acts of obedience nor is He harmed by any acts of disobedience from the humans and Jinn. But He is Compassionate and Merciful with His Servants and He is the One Who guides them to obey Him and avoid disobeying Him. These crises and disasters are no more than warners for Allah's Servants to return to Him (Exalted be He) and ordeals by which He tests them.

I have read an article written by the person, called Ahmad Baha' Al­Din in some newspapers. He alleged the lawfulness of some things that Allah prohibits. In his column \"Yawmiyyat\", (Al­Ahram Newspaper, issues nos. 36992, 36993, 36994, 36996), the writer launched a severe attack on Hijab (veil) and Niqab (face veil). He called to unveiling the face and considered Hijab a Bid`ah (innovation in religion). He claimed it is just a matter of dress that is part of personal freedom. He even alleged that women used to wear Niqab as a tradition and Islam did not ordain or come with it. He falsely claimed that women used to sit with the Prophet (peace be upon him) unveiled and used to go for trade, pasturing and war with their faces uncovered and they remained in such a state during the era of the Rightly­Guided Caliphs, the Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates. He said that when the Turks embraced Islam, they spread their non­Islamic traditions of their tribes, such as the one­eyed veil, yashmak, and imposed them on Muslim and Arab women. The writer expressed his views on the permissibility of unveiling the face, denied Hijab, inserted false claims and lies, and twisted the proofs to give different implications.",

We informed those in charge of the magazine that it is to include the writings of thinkers and scholars from all corners of the world not just from the Islamic University, so it can be a meeting point that gathers all these works, especially when it is the magazine issued from Al­Madinah Al­Munawwarah, the Muslims' first capital and springboard for the noble Muslim conquerors, Du'ahs (callers to Islam), and reformers.",

In addition, when a Muslim speaks to a woman, should he look at her or at the ground? If the nature of the work necessitates that the Muslim manager speaks to the female worker separately and he in this case will have to be alone with her in his office, can the door be closed so that no one hears their conversation, what is the ruling on this case and similar cases such as the working of female sales and purchase representatives whose work obliges them to discuss with traders the matters of work separately and sometimes there are more than one male representative with a woman in a closed room, so what is the ruling in this regard?",

Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment. He (Glorified be He) also says: By Al­'Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al­Ma'ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al­Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh's Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd). Further, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Religion is sincerity!\" They said, \"To whom, O Messenger of Allah?\" He (peace be upon him) answered, \"To Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and the Imams (leaders) of Muslims and their common people.\" (Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])These Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and Hadith stress the obligation of advising one another, helping one another in goodness and exhorting one another to the Truth. Therefore, if a Muslim finds their brother neglecting any of the duties that Allah has laid upon him or committing a prohibited act, they should advise him, enjoin good and forbid evil with the aim of having a better society full of goodness and free from evil. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ' (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma'rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden)",

(Related by Muslim in his Sahih)Dear questioner, since you have advised your Muslim brother and guided him to the Right Path but he still insists on committing sins openly, you should abandon him and not take him as your friend. You should encourage others who may have an influence on him or whom he respects more to advise him and invite him to Allah, maybe he will be guided. However, if you find that abandoning him makes him commit more sins whereas being in contact with him deters him and is better for his religion, do not abandon him. Basically, abandonment is meant as a remedy and if the remedy increases the illness, drop it and keep on advising him, enjoining good and forbidding evil without taking him as a companion or a close friend, may Allah bring benefit by it. This is the best opinion given by Muslim scholars (may Allah be merciful to them all) in this regard.",

You should bear in mind that I was ignorant of this ruling when I borrowed them. Moreover, the library was of no interest for the teachers or students. Besides, I benefit from these books much, particularly the religious ones, and I do not want to give them back.\" What is the ruling? May Allah reward you well.",

Allah (Glorified be He) says, And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years ­ give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) orders us to thank parents along with thanking Him and to accompany them in this worldly life with appropriate kindness, even if they strive to make one disbelieve in Allah. Thus, you learn that Islam enjoins on you to behave kindly with your father and do good to him even if he does you wrong. You should strive to call him to Al­Haqq (the Truth), hoping that Allah may guide him through you. It is not permissible for you to obey him in a sin. We advise you also to seek help from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to guide him and then from your righteous relatives such as uncles and others whom your father appreciate and respect hoping that he may accept their advice. We ask Allah to grant us, you and your father guidance and sincere Tawbah. He is All­ Hearer, Ever Near.

Ruling according to other than Shari'ah includes judgment according to man­made laws which are laid down by Christians, Jews and the like who claim that it is permissible to use these laws in judgment, or claim that they are better than or as good as Allah's Laws, and that people have the choice either to rule according to the Qur'an and Sunnah or man­made laws. Indeed, anyone who believes in the validity of these aforementioned claims has committed Kufr by the Ijma' (consensus) of Muslim scholars as mentioned previously. As for those who rule by other than Allah's revealed Law to satisfy an inclination or to secure a transient worldly gain, while admitting that by doing so they are disobeying Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and have committed a grave Munkar (an act unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and that it is obligatory on them to rule according to Allah's Law, they will not be guilty of major Kufr. Nevertheless, they are guilty of a grave Munkar, a major sin and a minor act of Kufr (disbelief); this is the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and other scholars. By doing so they are judged to have committed an act of Kufr, Zhulm (injustice), and Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law) that does take them out of Islam, as it does not constitute major Kufr.",

(Related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih)There are so many Hadiths carrying the same meaning, which prove the impermissibility of Isbal (lengthening and trailing clothing below the ankles) at all, even if one claims that he does not intend pride and arrogance, for this may lead to arrogance and is a kind of extravagance and exposing clothes to dirt and impurities. However, if arrogance is intended, the sin is more grave, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Anyone who trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection. The allowable limit is till the ankles; it is not permissible for the Muslim to lower his clothes below the ankles, based on the abovementioned Hadiths.

If one knows that a certain perfume contains prohibited ingredients such as alcohol or a kind of impurity one must abandon it. This includes eau de cologne, for it is proved medically that it contains a percentage of alcohol which is an intoxicant, so one should abandon it, unless there are pure kinds. All praise be to Allah, there are so many perfumes which Allah has made lawful that make us dispense with using those which contain alcohol. Similarly, any kind of food or drink that contains intoxicants should be abandoned. The rule is whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is Haram (prohibited).

It is obligatory to keep graves away from the Masjids and not to place graves inside them in compliance to the command of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and to be aware of the Curse that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) placed on those who built Masjids over graves. When one offers Salah in Masjids which contain graves, Satan may deceive them into supplicating to the dead, seeking their help, or prostrating to them. Doing so may cause them to fall into major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). This is one of the practices of the Jews and the Christians and it is obligatory to differ from them and avoid their practices and evil ways. However, if the grave is old and a Masjid is built over it, it is obligatory to demolish the Masjid because it is newly built, as held by the people of knowledge, in order to block the means which may lead to Shirk.

I am the elder of my sisters and brothers so my father came to me at first and told me that he had a piece of land in Al­'Umrah district and that he will give me half of it and build a Masjid (mosque) on the remaining part. I accepted his gift, thanked him and supplicated Allah for him. Afterwards, he told me that the concerned bodies of the government did not admit the division of the land and therefore he would give this land to my two sisters who may agree to sell or build over the entire lot, or one of them may assign her share to the other in return for a sum of money she gives to her sister. It is worth mentioning that both my sisters are employed and are able to pay the money even in installments. My father has another piece of land in Al­Riyadh which he gave to my brothers and another one which he gave to their mother who is not his wife anymore. He asked me to choose between two pieces of land in Al­Khubr and three in Al­Khafjy or two pieces in Al­Ta'if one of them in Al­Huda district and the other one lies in Buhrah; he gave me time to think about which one I would choose. I later chose the one in Buhrah district even though I had not seen it yet. He, on his part, gave me its title deed. Now, I find that I have been wronged; so is it permissible for me to ask him to replace this piece of land with another? Please, put your Fatwa at the bottom of my question. May Allah reward you best!",

Puberty is attained by completing the age of fifteen, discharging of semen out of sexual desire in a sexual dream and the like, or growing coarse hair around the frontal genital area, and in case of women, menstruation period is also added. Moreover, his guardian should fulfill the Zakah and other financial duties on his behalf, as they should also teach him whatever is unknown to him by all possible means until he understands Allah's Obligations and Prohibitions. Allah (Glorified be He) says: So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If I command you to do something, do as much of it as you can . Thus, the Mukallaf who does not hear, talk, or is inflicted with dumbness or deafness should fear Allah as much as they can through abiding by obligations and avoiding prohibitions.
