Thus, the Ayah means that those who have complete fear of Allah are those who know their Lord through His Names and Attributes and His Great Right and they are aware of His Shari'ah (Divine Law) and believe in the blessings stored for those who fear Him and the punishment stored for those who forsake and disobey Him. Hence, because of their profound knowledge about Allah, they are the most fearful and reverential towards Allah; and at the head of them are the prophets and messengers (peace be upon them) and then their succeeding scholars who possess knowledge about Allah and His Din but their fear is in varying degrees. However, the Ayah does not mean that no one fears Allah except the scholars (those who possess knowledge). All Muslims and believers, male and female, fear Allah, but their fear is in varying degrees and not of the same grade. Therefore, the more the believer possesses knowledge about Allah and comprehends His Din, the greater is their fear of Allah. If their knowledge is less, so is their understanding and awareness of Allah and His Din and subsequently their fear of Allah. Thus, people are of varying degrees in this matter and so are the scholars as already stated. The more there is knowledge about Din, the greater there is fear of Allah and the less there is knowledge about Din, the less there is fear of Allah. That is why Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad ﺻﻠﻰ ﺍﷲ ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﻭﺳﻠﻢ) including all obligations ordered by Islâm] and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures.",

That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allâh, i.e. commit crimes and sins).    In another narration, it reads:  \"The first failing to begin among the Children of Israel was that a man would meet another man and say, 'O so and so! Fear Allah and abstain from what you are doing. It is not lawful for you.' Then he would meet him again the next day but this (the sin he saw him doing) would not prevent him from eating, drinking and sitting with him. When they did this, Allah caused the hearts of some to be tainted by the others.\"",

It is not permissible for non-Muslims to live in this Peninsula due to the reasons mentioned above, except for a pressing need, like vendors who sell imported goods and non-Muslim envoys coming as representatives of their countries to meet with top officials in this Peninsula. However, it is not permissible to allow them permanent residence in this country. Also, it is not permissible to give them citizenship, as this will facilitate their permanent residence, due to the Messenger's (peace be upon him) command mentioned earlier. Any non-Muslim who is permitted to enter the country must be prevented from publicly practicing their religious rites. Bringing them to the Arabian Peninsula for employment is not permissible. Rather, Muslims are to beware of them and to dispense with them by appointing Muslim workers. Muslims should be given priority to occupy all vacancies. However, in some special cases, this restriction can be lifted when there is an extreme necessity deemed by those in authority. Therefore, non-Muslims may be recruited to take jobs or professions that Muslims cannot do. Upon completing such tasks, they are to be returned to their countries. The Prophet (peace be upon him) permitted the Jews to stay in Khaybar when there was a need for that.

From 'Adam (peace be upon him) and then Noah, they preached the mission in Masjids and Minbars whether the Minbar is inside the Masjid or outside, built or made of wood. A camel, horse, or any other animal or raised place may be used as a Minbar to convey Allah's Message. In conclusion, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has ordained His slaves to convey His Message and teach people what His Messengers brought by any possible means. The Masjid and the Minbar are the most important means that can be used for conveying this Message and spreading Da`wah, as the Masjid is the place where Muslims gather for many events, such as the Jumu`ah (Friday) Prayer.

Also it embraces doing good deeds, as iman is words and deeds; it increases by obedience and decreases by sin, according to the understanding of Ahl­ul­Sunnah wal­Jama'ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body). True Iman is spoken by the heart, and on the lips, and expressed by the action of the heart and body; the action of the heart is through love, devotion, fear, hope, and longing for Allah.

It is reported in the Hadith which wasrecorded by Imam Ahmad and others with a good chain of narrationfrom Thawban (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The people will soon summon one another to attack you as people when eating; they invite others to share their food. Someone asked: Will that be because of our small numbers at that time? He replied: No, at that time, you will be numerous: but you will be scum and rubbish like that carried down by a torrent, and Allah will take out the fear of you from the breasts of your enemy and throw Wahn into your hearts. Someone asked: What is Wahn, O Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): He replied: Love of the world and dislike of death.",

I testify that there is no deity but Allah Alone Who has no partner, the Deity of earlier and later generations, Who has sent His Messengers and revealed His Books to establish proof and clarify that Allah (Glorified be He) is the Only One deserving worship and obedience, and that His Shari`ah (Islamic law) must be followed and anything which opposes it must be avoided. I testify that Muhammad is the Servant and Messenger of Allah, who was sent as a mercy to all beings and a proof against them. Allah (Exalted be He) sent him with guidance and the religion of truth to make it superior over all religions and ordered him to inform the people about their religious duties.

And remember Him (by invoking Allâh for all good.) as He has guided you, and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray. Then depart from the place whence all the people depart and ask Allâh for His Forgiveness. Truly, Allâh is Oft­Forgiving, Most­Merciful. until His Saying: And remember Allâh during the appointed Days. But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him",

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever performs Hajj and does not have sexual relations (with their wives) nor commits sins (during Hajj) will return (as sinless) as a newborn baby. This denotes that it is not permissible to have sexual relations before Tahallul (removal of the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) or to say or commit anything calling to this as it is not permissible to commit sins, whether verbally or practically. Also, one must refrain from engaging in disputes except for the sake of achieving goodness. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well­known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islâmic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihrâm), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. In fact, all the rituals of Hajj represent an invitation to obey Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), to glorify and remember Allah, to abstain from committing sins, and to refrain from engaging in disputes which cause enmity and division among the Muslims. Disputing gently for the sake of achieving goodness is required in every place and at all times.

This is how Da`wah (calling to Islam) should be approached at all times and in all places, whether in the Ka`bah or elsewhere. When calling others, a Da`y (caller to Islam) must use wisdom, which is knowledge of what Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger has ordained, and fair preaching; and must not be harsh or hurt people. It is permissible to engage in a dispute in a way that is better whenever it is necessary to remove doubts and explain Al­Haqq. However, one must engage in a dispute using kind words and useful good techniques, which remove doubts and guide to Al­Haqq without any aggression.",

I advise them to be on their guard against extravagance and negligence since every Islamic call or action is afflicted with one of two satanic insinuations: remissness and excessiveness. Therefore, scholars and people of insight should support this call and direct those who lead it toward moderation and warn them against excessiveness, lest this should lead them to Bid`ah (innovated in religion) or failing to fulfill the rights of Allah (Exalted be He). I appeal to them to Islamize their call through adherence to the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) and the right path. This can be achieved through devotion to Allah (Exalted be He) and following His Messenger (peace be upon him) with neither excessiveness nor remissness. If they do so, this Islamic movement will be fruitful. The leaders of this movement in particular should be interested in this matter and attend to it, thus avoiding both opposite ends.

This is a mistake that has no basis in the purified Shari`ah. Rather, it is a Bid`ah, which Allah has not sent down. This celebration may involve prohibited acts, such as drinking Khamr (intoxicants) and intermixing of men and women. Moreover, poems that may contain Major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) may be chanted in such an occasion, such as the famous poem of Al­Burdah by Al­Busairy where he says:",

They do not approve of any classification of Bid`ah and quote the Prophet's statement in this regard: Every Bid`ah leads to misguidance.

Linguistically speaking, Bid`ah signifies an unprecedented thing. Allah (may he be Glorified) describes Himself, The Originator of the heavens and the earth. i.e. He created heaven and earth without any previous example. The term 'Bid`ah' applies to any invented matter in Islam that has no basis in the Qur'an and Sunnah.

Muslims should also beware of innovations in Islam ­ as Allah has warned ­ that lead to imitating the enemies of Allah and following their Bid`ah. This does not refer only to the mother, for Allah has ordered Muslims to be dutiful to their parents and to treat them kindly and to keep good relations with kith and kin. He (Glorified be He) warns Muslims against ungratefulness and severing ties of kinship, especially with the mother who assumes a huge responsibility and endures hardships in caring for and bringing up the child. Allah (Glorified be He) states: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. Allah (Exalted be He) states: And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years ­ give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. He also states: Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship?

I thank Him (He may be Glorified) for prescribing the obligation of Hajj (pilgrimage) to His Sacred House where Muslims from all over the world meet each other: That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade), and mention the Name of Allâh on appointed days (i.e. 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th day of Dhul­Hijjah), over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice), [at the time of their slaughtering by saying: (Bismillah, Wallâhu­ Akbar, Allâhumma Minka wa Ilaik)]. They gather to worship Him alone, single Him out with all forms of good deeds, and submit their needs to Him at His Ancient House as well as in the Sacred Rites. They supplicate to Him at `Arafat and Muzdalifah to ask for His forgiveness, accepting their Hajj, saving them from Hellfire, circumambulating His Ancient House, and walking between Al­Safa and Al­Marwah, seeking His Mercy and fearing His punishment as did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Companions. They come from every place to perform this great obligatory rite and perform",

Undoubtedly, the benefits of Hajj are countless. It is a Divine grace that Hajj is observed annually and required only once in one's lifetime. Allah (may He be Praised and Glorified) prescribed it yearly as a supererogatory act in order to draw closer to Him. As for the obligation, it must be fulfilled once in a lifetime for those who can afford it. Allah made this honorable mosque, Al­Masjid Al­Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah) and the Prophet's Masjid (peace be upon him) in Al­Madinah Al­Munawwarah a meeting place for His pious servants, scholars, and Muslims from all over the world to benefit from their Hajj and visit the Prophet's Mosque in order to draw near to their Lord, worship Him alone, benefit from the scholars, Du`ah (callers) to Allah, and from the sessions of knowledge that are held in the two Sacred Masjids.

Allah (Exalted be He) says: Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allâh, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much. (See the Qur'ân Verse 35:45). Allah (Supreme is His Might) is Forbearing, Oft­Forgiving and Merciful towards His Servants. He sent them signs and warners so they would return to Him, and He accepts their Tawbah (repentance to Allah). When a Servant draws closer to their Lord (may He be Praised) a hand's length, He (may He be Praised) draws closer to them an arm's length, because Allah (Exalted be He) loves that His Servants make Tawbah and is pleased with it, even though He is in no need of His Servants. He (Exalted be He) is not benefitted by any acts of obedience nor is He harmed by any acts of disobedience from the humans and Jinn. But He is Compassionate and Merciful with His Servants and He is the One Who guides them to obey Him and avoid disobeying Him. These crises and disasters are no more than warners for Allah's Servants to return to Him (Exalted be He) and ordeals by which He tests them. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to A s­Sâbirûn (the patient).",

Worship, which is the wisdom behind sending the Messengers and revealing the books, is the right of Allah upon His Slaves, whether males or females, jinn or human, Arabs or non-Arabs, the rich or the poor and the rulers or the ruled. All of them are created in order to worship Allah and act according to the teachings of the Messengers and the revealed books. Both the jinn and mankind are ordered to obey Allah and His Messenger, because they are created to worship, glorify, and obey Allah (Exalted be He).",

I have read an article written by the person, called Ahmad Baha' Al­Din in some newspapers. He alleged the lawfulness of some things that Allah prohibits. In his column \"Yawmiyyat\", (Al­Ahram Newspaper, issues nos. 36992, 36993, 36994, 36996), the writer launched a severe attack on Hijab (veil) and Niqab (face veil). He called to unveiling the face and considered Hijab a Bid`ah (innovation in religion). He claimed it is just a matter of dress that is part of personal freedom. He even alleged that women used to wear Niqab as a tradition and Islam did not ordain or come with it. He falsely claimed that women used to sit with the Prophet (peace be upon him) unveiled and used to go for trade, pasturing and war with their faces uncovered and they remained in such a state during the era of the Rightly­Guided Caliphs, the Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates. He said that when the Turks embraced Islam, they spread their non­Islamic traditions of their tribes, such as the one­eyed veil, yashmak, and imposed them on Muslim and Arab women. The writer expressed his views on the permissibility of unveiling the face, denied Hijab, inserted false claims and lies, and twisted the proofs to give different implications.",

This is how the jurists and scholars explained the Hadith, such as the prominent scholar Al­San`any (may Allah be merciful with him). Thus, it is clear that a woman must wear Hijab and cover her face, and that she is forbidden to disclose any part of her body or adornment except what unintentionally appears. This ban blocks the means of temptation. Thus, any person who calls for anything else commits a mistake and contradicts the Shar`y (Islamically lawful) proofs.

It involved terrorizing pilgrims visiting Al­Bayt (the House: another name for the Ka`bah), threatening peace, violating sanctity of this sacred country and harming people. Allah (Glorified be He) made this country sacred until the Day of Resurrection and made the blood, wealth and honor of Muslims inviolable. He (Glorified be He) ordains that violating them is among the gravest crimes and major sins and promises anyone who commits such a crime in the sacred country severe punishment. Allah (Glorified be He) states: and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islâmic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment. If anyone inclines to do a wrong deed in the Haram (all areas within the Sacred Sanctuary of Makkah) and does not do it is promised a painful torment; what about those who actually carry it out? Their crime will definitely be graver and punishment severer.",

There should be supervisors visiting these movements from time to time, to learn about their activities, honesty, and needs, who can guide them in what they should do, and ease the difficulties they may be facing. We should know the people or organizations that are supporting the enemies and aiding them secretly or openly, so the Islamic movements can be aware of them and treat them in the appropriate way.

Those responsible should be truthful in their efforts of Da'wah (calling to Islam) and have an honest desire to guide the people and the youth to Islam. This also means that attention should be paid to the environment, to reform and purify it from these epidemics. The remedy also includes prohibiting travel abroad, except for necessities, paying attention to spreading pure purposeful Islamic awareness by means of the mass media, teachers, Du'ah (callers to Islam), and preachers. I ask Allah to grant us this and correct the Muslim's leaders and guide them to comprehend the Din, adhere to it, and fight those who contradict it, and to do so with honesty, sincerity, and ceaseless efforts!

However, my advice to a knowledge seeker is not to slacken in Da`wah, claiming that there are others carrying out that important task. Nevertheless, he should call to Allah (Exalted be He) according to his capability and knowledge, but not to engage himself in what he can not bear. He should also call to Allah (Exalted be He) according to his knowledge, endeavor to cite the evidence, and never say anything about Allah (Exalted be He) without knowledge. He should not also despise himself so long as he has knowledge and good understanding of religion.",

If this Tawassul takes the form of following and loving him, obeying his orders, refraining from his prohibitions, and being sincere to Allah in worship, this is Islam and the Religion with which Allah sent His Prophets. In fact, every Mukallaf (person meeting the conditions to be held legally accountable for their actions) is obligated to perform these duties, which are the means to attain happiness in the world and the Hereafter. As for making Tawassul by supplicating to the Prophet, seeking his help, asking for his support against enemies, and entreating him to cure the sick, these are kinds of major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), which embody the religion of Abu Jahl and other idol worshippers. The same applies to making Tawassul by other prophets, Awliya' (pious people), Jinn (creatures created from fire), angels, trees, stones, or idols.",

This is a Bid'ah (innovation in religion) and a means leading to Shirk. Accordingly, it is not permissible to use this kind of Tawassul neither with the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor with any other person, because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has not prescribed this. Moreover, acts of worship are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and thus it is not permissible to consider as lawful what is not supported by a proof from the Purified Shar' (Law) of Allah. As for the incident of the blind man who made Tawassul by the Prophet (peace be upon him) during his lifetime, he entreated the Prophet (peace be upon him) to supplicate and intercede to Allah for him to return his eyesight to him; he did not make Tawassul by the Prophet's self, status, or right as was indicated from the wording of the Hadith and clarified by the scholars who explained it.",

Allah (Exalted be He) says: Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: \"We believe in Allâh and the Last Day\" while in fact they believe not. Therefore, it is obligatory to believe deep in the heart and have Yaqin (certainty) that there is no true deity except Allah. And if one disdains to submit to the Shar' (Law) of Allah, they have committed Kufr (disbelief) and their pronouncing the Two Shahadahs will not avail them.

Therefore, if a Muslim finds their brother neglecting any of the duties that Allah has laid upon him or committing a prohibited act, they should advise him, enjoin good and forbid evil with the aim of having a better society full of goodness and free from evil. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ' (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma'rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden)",

(Related by Muslim in his Sahih)Dear questioner, since you have advised your Muslim brother and guided him to the Right Path but he still insists on committing sins openly, you should abandon him and not take him as your friend. You should encourage others who may have an influence on him or whom he respects more to advise him and invite him to Allah, maybe he will be guided. However, if you find that abandoning him makes him commit more sins whereas being in contact with him deters him and is better for his religion, do not abandon him. Basically, abandonment is meant as a remedy and if the remedy increases the illness, drop it and keep on advising him, enjoining good and forbidding evil without taking him as a companion or a close friend, may Allah bring benefit by it.

Allah (Glorified be He) says, And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years ­ give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) orders us to thank parents along with thanking Him and to accompany them in this worldly life with appropriate kindness, even if they strive to make one disbelieve in Allah. Thus, you learn that Islam enjoins on you to behave kindly with your father and do good to him even if he does you wrong. You should strive to call him to Al­Haqq (the Truth), hoping that Allah may guide him through you. It is not permissible for you to obey him in a sin. We advise you also to seek help from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to guide him and then from your righteous relatives such as uncles and others whom your father appreciate and respect hoping that he may accept their advice. We ask Allah to grant us, you and your father guidance and sincere Tawbah. He is All­ Hearer, Ever Near.

Anyone who rules by laws other than those laid down by Allah while knowing the obligation of ruling according to the Law revealed by Allah, and is aware that by doing so they have violated the Shari'ah (Islamic law), but in spite of this they regard this matter as permissible and believe that they have done nothing wrong and that it is permissible to rule by other than Allah's Law is a Kafir (disbeliever) who is guilty of major Kufr (disbelief) according to all Muslim scholars. Ruling according to other than Shari'ah includes judgment according to man­made laws which are laid down by Christians, Jews and the like who claim that it is permissible to use these laws in judgment, or claim that they are better than or as good as Allah's Laws, and that people have the choice either to rule according to the Qur'an and Sunnah or man­made laws. Indeed, anyone who believes in the validity of these aforementioned claims has committed Kufr by the Ijma' (consensus) of Muslim scholars as mentioned previously. As for those who rule by other than Allah's revealed Law to satisfy an inclination or to secure a transient worldly gain, while admitting that by doing so they are disobeying Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and have committed a grave Munkar (an act unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and that it is obligatory on them to rule according to Allah's Law, they will not be guilty of major Kufr. Nevertheless, they are guilty of a grave Munkar, a major sin and a minor act of Kufr (disbelief); this is the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and other scholars. By doing so they are judged to have committed an act of Kufr, Zhulm (injustice), and Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law) that does take them out of Islam, as it does not constitute major Kufr.",

The people asked the group of Sahabah to recite Ruqyah (Qur'an and supplications recited over the sick seeking healing). So, one of the Sahabah went and recited Surah Al­Fatihah and blew over the chief who was cured. The Sahabah stipulated to take from them a flock of sheep in return for their Ruqyah and the people paid them what they agreed upon. The Sahabah did not divide the sheep until they asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about the matter, and he replied, \"You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well.\" (Related by Al­Bukhari in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not disapprove of what they had done. He (peace be upon him) also said, The most deserving thing for which you take payment is the Book of Allah.

Allah has utterly forbidden all forms of extravagance and squandering of wealth. Likewise, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade dissipating money. This also encourages making shapes of birds and other animate creatures and hanging in the home, office, etc, which is categorically prohibited in Islam. Therefore, it is not permissible to sell or own them. The Muhtasib should explain to people that it is prohibited to make or own such things, and he should take the necessary measures to ban dealing in them in the markets. Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) spread among the people of Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him) because they set up statues for Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasra (names of some idols) who were righteous men among Nuh's people. They died in close succession, so Satan made it fair­seeming to erect idols in their names and hold them in their meeting places. Ever since, Shirk found its way among the people of Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him). This was reported by Al­Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him) in his Sahih on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both).

(Related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih)There are so many Hadiths carrying the same meaning, which prove the impermissibility of Isbal (lengthening and trailing clothing below the ankles) at all, even if one claims that he does not intend pride and arrogance, for this may lead to arrogance and is a kind of extravagance and exposing clothes to dirt and impurities. However, if arrogance is intended, the sin is more grave, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Anyone who trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection. The allowable limit is till the ankles; it is not permissible for the Muslim to lower his clothes below the ankles, based on the abovementioned Hadiths.

Otherwise, the original rule is that all perfumes, such as aloes, ambergris, musk, etc. are lawful. If one knows that a certain perfume contains prohibited ingredients such as alcohol or a kind of impurity one must abandon it. This includes eau de cologne, for it is proved medically that it contains a percentage of alcohol which is an intoxicant, so one should abandon it, unless there are pure kinds. All praise be to Allah, there are so many perfumes which Allah has made lawful that make us dispense with using those which contain alcohol. Similarly, any kind of food or drink that contains intoxicants should be abandoned. The rule is whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is Haram (prohibited). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: If a large amount of anything causes intoxication, a small amount of it is Haram. May Allah grant us success.",

It is obligatory to keep graves away from the Masjids and not to place graves inside them in compliance to the command of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and to be aware of the Curse that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) placed on those who built Masjids over graves. When one offers Salah in Masjids which contain graves, Satan may deceive them into supplicating to the dead, seeking their help, or prostrating to them. Doing so may cause them to fall into major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). This is one of the practices of the Jews and the Christians and it is obligatory to differ from them and avoid their practices and evil ways. However, if the grave is old and a Masjid is built over it, it is obligatory to demolish the Masjid because it is newly built, as held by the people of knowledge, in order to block the means which may lead to Shirk.

I will explain my problem to Your Eminence and I ask Allah to help you find a solution for it. We are three sisters and two brothers born to different mothers. Two of my sisters are full sisters but I have another mother. Our father, may Allah reward him well, wished to give each of us a piece of land in his lifetime. I am the elder of my sisters and brothers so my father came to me at first and told me that he had a piece of land in Al­'Umrah district and that he will give me half of it and build a Masjid (mosque) on the remaining part. I accepted his gift, thanked him and supplicated Allah for him. Afterwards, he told me that the concerned bodies of the government did not admit the division of the land and therefore he would give this land to my two sisters who may agree to sell or build over the entire lot, or one of them may assign her share to the other in return for a sum of money she gives to her sister. It is worth mentioning that both my sisters are employed and are able to pay the money even in installments. My father has another piece of land in Al­Riyadh which he gave to my brothers and another one which he gave to their mother who is not his wife anymore. He asked me to choose between two pieces of land in Al­Khubr and three in Al­Khafjy or two pieces in Al­Ta'if one of them in Al­Huda district and the other one lies in Buhrah; he gave me time to think about which one I would choose. I later chose the one in Buhrah district even though I had not seen it yet. He, on his part, gave me its title deed. Now, I find that I have been wronged; so is it permissible for me to ask him to replace this piece of land with another? Please, put your Fatwa at the bottom of my question. May Allah reward you best!",
