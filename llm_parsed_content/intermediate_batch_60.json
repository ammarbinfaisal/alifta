          "text": "A: Possessing embalmed birds and animals, whether lawful or unlawful to own if alive, is a waste of money and a type of extravagance because of the cost of embalmment. Allah has utterly forbidden all forms of extravagance and squandering of wealth. Likewise, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade dissipating money. This also encourages making shapes of birds and other animate creatures and hanging in the home, office, etc, which is categorically prohibited in Islam. Therefore, it is not permissible to sell or own them. The Muhtasib should explain to people that it is prohibited to make or own such things, and he should take the necessary measures to ban dealing in them in the markets. Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) spread among the people of Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him) because they set up statues for Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasra (names of some idols) who were righteous men among Nuh's people. They died in close succession, so Satan made it fair­seeming to erect idols in their names and hold them in their meeting places. Ever since, Shirk found its way among the people of Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him). This was reported by Al­Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him) in his Sahih on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both). This also was reported by other Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur'an), Muhaddiths (Hadith scholars), and historians. Allah is the One sought for help! There is neither might nor power except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.",

(Related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih)There are so many Hadiths carrying the same meaning, which prove the impermissibility of Isbal (lengthening and trailing clothing below the ankles) at all, even if one claims that he does not intend pride and arrogance, for this may lead to arrogance and is a kind of extravagance and exposing clothes to dirt and impurities. However, if arrogance is intended, the sin is more grave, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Anyone who trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection. The allowable limit is till the ankles; it is not permissible for the Muslim to lower his clothes below the ankles, based on the abovementioned Hadiths. However, a woman should wear long clothes that cover her feet.",

On the contrary, whoever intends to trail his garment is to be accused of conceit and his act is a means for this. Allah Alone (Glorified be He) knows what lies in the hearts. The Prophet (peace be upon him) generally warned in his Hadiths against Isbal without excluding the one who trails his garment without conceit.

If one knows that a certain perfume contains prohibited ingredients such as alcohol or a kind of impurity one must abandon it. This includes eau de cologne, for it is proved medically that it contains a percentage of alcohol which is an intoxicant, so one should abandon it, unless there are pure kinds. All praise be to Allah, there are so many perfumes which Allah has made lawful that make us dispense with using those which contain alcohol. Similarly, any kind of food or drink that contains intoxicants should be abandoned. The rule is whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is Haram (prohibited).

This is one of the practices of the Jews and the Christians and it is obligatory to differ from them and avoid their practices and evil ways.

I will explain my problem to Your Eminence and I ask Allah to help you find a solution for it. We are three sisters and two brothers born to different mothers. Two of my sisters are full sisters but I have another mother. Our father, may Allah reward him well, wished to give each of us a piece of land in his lifetime. I am the elder of my sisters and brothers so my father came to me at first and told me that he had a piece of land in Al­'Umrah district and that he will give me half of it and build a Masjid (mosque) on the remaining part. I accepted his gift, thanked him and supplicated Allah for him. Afterwards, he told me that the concerned bodies of the government did not admit the division of the land and therefore he would give this land to my two sisters who may agree to sell or build over the entire lot, or one of them may assign her share to the other in return for a sum of money she gives to her sister. It is worth mentioning that both my sisters are employed and are able to pay the money even in installments. My father has another piece of land in Al­Riyadh which he gave to my brothers and another one which he gave to their mother who is not his wife anymore. He asked me to choose between two pieces of land in Al­Khubr and three in Al­Khafjy or two pieces in Al­Ta'if one of them in Al­Huda district and the other one lies in Buhrah; he gave me time to think about which one I would choose. I later chose the one in Buhrah district even though I had not seen it yet. He, on his part, gave me its title deed. Now, I find that I have been wronged; so is it permissible for me to ask him to replace this piece of land with another? Please, put your Fatwa at the bottom of my question.
